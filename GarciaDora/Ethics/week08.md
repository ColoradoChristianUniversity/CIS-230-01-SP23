# Scenario
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

## Option 1: Talk to my boss and ask for credit.

### Pros:
- I may get recognition for the hard work that was put in by both of us.
- It would allow for an explanation of the situation.
- Allows for clarification on both sides.

### Cons: 
- Coworker may get in trouble for knowingly taking full credit.
- Coworker may be upset with me

### Script:
- Me: Hey, boss, I wanted to talk about my coworker and the raise and credit he got. As you may know, I have been working with this person for six months, so we worked on this project together. They received a raise and got full credit for it while we both worked on it.
Boss: I see. I understand your concern and will talk to others to see what can be done.

### Scripture:
- Ephesians 4:29 (NIV) - "Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen"

### Principle: 
- Talking to authorities in this situation may clarify the mistake they probably made without acknowledging it.

## Option 2: Talk to my teammate and ask questions.

### Pros:
- My teammate may understand and let others know to get the recognition for me.
- May allow getting credit for the work done.
- There may be clarification as to what has happened.

### Cons: 
- Teammate may not want to give up their new position.
- There may be tension created between my teammate and me if they are aware of the situation. 
### Script:
Me: Hey, I wanted to ask you about the raise and the credit you got on our project together.
Teammate: Oh yeah, what did you want to ask?
Well, we worked on this project together as I was mentoring you, I understand how the credit may have appeared to be only yours, but I would like to ask that I receive some credit for it as well. 
Oh, of course! I was not aware that the credit was only given to me. I will talk to my supervisor. 

### Scripture:
- Proverbs 15:1 (NIV) - "A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger."

### Principle: 
- Direct communication in a situation like this may be the best way to resolve any issues before they get out of hand.

## Option 3: Ask another coworker for advice.

### Pros:
- It would be helpful to get a different perspective on the situation.
- Coworker may help me in doing the right thing. 

### Cons: 
- My coworker may not know what to do to help me.
-  They may not give the best advice on the situation.

### Script:
Me: Hey. I wanted to ask you for some advice.
Them: Sure! What is going on?
Me: I had been working with this person for six months, and we worked on a big project together. They received a raise and got full credit for it. I don’t want any problems with this person, but I am unsure if they know I received no recognition. What do you suggest I should do?

### Scripture:
- James 1:19 (NIV) - “My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.”

### Principle: 
-  It is always wise to ask people with more knowledge or someone we trust for advice before taking an action on something.

# Conclusion
The issue here is that the person I have been mentoring for six months, with no progress, received a raise and full credit for what we had been working on together. This was a mistake by the company leadership; however, nothing has been done to fix it. If my teammate accepted this raise and credit for the project, knowing that they were not the only ones to deserve the credit, there would be an issue as they are stealing the credit from me as their mentor. If this is true, this person may continue to do this in the future and hurt other workers and even the company, as his knowledge level is not suitable for the position. 

# My Choice
I would talk to my teammate about what I understand is going on and ask for clarification. I would like to know if they willingly took the full credit for the project we both worked on and received the promotion knowing they were likely not ready for it. Suppose after talking with my coworker, I learn that they know about the mistake and are not willing to do anything about it. In that case, I may go directly to my supervisor and talk to them about the situation and how I feel that there has been no progress in their learning, so they might have to rethink their decision. 

My teammate may have unknowingly taken credit for the project, and after talking about this, they may be willing to talk to our supervisor and resolve the issue.
