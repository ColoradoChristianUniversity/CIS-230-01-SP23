# Scenario
While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response
## Option 1: Talk to authorities about extending the deadline.

### Pros:
 - Gives me more time to work on the project
 - Allows for less pressure.
 - Might have more time to find a faster solution to the problem

### Cons:
 - The problem may be urgent.
 - Will delay the completion of the problem.
 - Authorities may not agree on extending the deadline.

### Script:
 - Me: “I have been trying to solve this problem, but it seems extremely complicated to be done in 2 months. I was wondering if it is possible to extend the deadline.”
 - Authorities: “We will look into how urgent this is and get back to you.”
 - Me: “I appreciate it, thank you. I will keep working on it in the meantime.”

### Scripture:

> Matthew 7:7 (NIV) - “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.”


### First principle:
Acknowledging that something may be out of your control and asking for help is sometimes more beneficial than keeping the struggle to yourself.

## Option 2: Ask a Coworker for advice on what to do.

### Pros:

 - Coworker may give good advice.
 - Coworker may know what to do.
 - Coworker may know of a better solution.

### Cons:

 - The project might be private to only the people working on it.
 - Coworker may not know what to do. 
 - Coworker could give bad advice.

### Script:
 - Me: “Hey, I am working on this project, and the problem is extremely hard to solve. I only have two months to finish, but I found a third-party software that can do the job. However, it could take up to 6 months to get it.”
 - Coworker: “Wow, that sounds intense.”
 - Me: “Yes, I am troubled about what to do. Do you have any advice for me?”

### Scripture:

> Galatians 6:2 (NIV) - “Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.”

### First principle:
We need help from others in decision-making.

## Option 3: Look for other choices for solving the problem in a faster way. 

### Pros:

 - May allow for a faster solution.
 - I might find something faster.
 - May allow for the problem to be solved.

### Cons:

 - May delay progress. 
 - There may not be another solution.
 

### Script:
- Me: “I am going to look for more resources for this problem to hopefully solve it sooner.”

### Scripture:

> Ecclesiastes 3:1 (NIV) - There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens”

### First principle:
Thinking outside the box may bring more solutions.


## Conclusion
The problem in this scenario is that the project needs to be done in 2 months, but it is extremely difficult to do it within such a short time frame. Finding the third-party software that can solve the problem, but seeing that it could take up to 6 months to obtain it, proves even further that this problem is extremely difficult. The problem needs to be done, but there seems to be no easy way.

## My Choice
In this situation, I would ask for an extension. It is unclear if the problem is urgent, so I would find out if it is necessary to get it done within two months or if extending the deadline is possible. The third-party software could take up to 6 months, but it could also take less time to obtain the solution. In either case, by asking for an extension, my authorities would see that I am in need of help, and they may provide me with other resources or people to help me if the extension is not possible.
