# Scenario
While maintaining a very popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Response to Julea Chappa’s Week 03 Ethics Response

### Julea has three choices for this scenario.
The first is not to complete what the authorities are asking you to do and risk your job.
The second option is to go ahead and build the back door code to help stop child trafficking but also bring risk to your company.
The third option is to look for other ways to stop this scheme without introducing a back door code. 
Julea picked option three as her first choice. She would like to follow her obligation to her company and not try to solve evil with evil.
### What I would choose:
My choice would be the same as Julea’s. I would offer to help in other ways without introducing the back door code. This would decrease the risks to our company and possibly allow us to find a better solution to this problem. 

## Response to Kelly Rants Week 03 Ethics Response
### Kelly has three great choices for this scenario.
The first one is to go ahead with what is being asked of you, to introduce the back door code and stop this scheme.
The second option is to completely deny the request since it poses too many risks, personal and professional.
Kelly’s third option is to do the back door code yourself, and instead of leaving it to the ones asking, you take the information straight to the police.
Kelly chose the third option as their first choice, and it makes sense that this might be a safer option than the first choice.

### What I would choose:
- Before I finished reading to the third choice, I thought that the second option might be the safest since Kelly pointed out scenarios I had not  fully thought about. However, he also said good points about how God desires for us to to fight for others, like those who cannot speak for themselves. If there was a way that I could do the code myself, such as how Kelly explained, I would do my best to try and stop the crime instead of backing away from this completely.
