# Prompt: Week 3 Prompt
While maintaining a very popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed 
evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Responses from Madeline
- Refuse the request because it might be illigal or voilate the privacy rights of users. This option avoids legal issues regarding privacy, but could risk your reputation
and your conscience because you didn't help the trafficked.
- Comply with the request and do everything to still allow for privacy. This allows for stopping the scheme,  but could damage reputation for allowing privacy problems
into open source projects.
- Seek legal advice from experts and seek advice from other coders in order to determine the best course of action. This option allows for a full response, because others
would provide advice, but also allows a lot more time for the scheme to develop.

## Responses from Bennett
- Ask the authorities for an alternative way to gather the evidence. This way would possibly show the door to an alternative solution, but also could point authorities away
from you as a possible source of help.
- Pray about it. This option would probably take more time, but opens up a door for direct intervention from the Lord regarding your descision.
- Say yes. This option helps stop the scheme, but also may be unethical, because of the privacy concerns.

## My choice:
In my opinion, I would agree with Madeline's second response. Overall, it would be unfortunate to introduce privacy concerns into an open source project, but it would be
worth it to me to stop the scheme. Personally, I don't think I would be able to live with myself if I let the scheme go on, so I would try to stop the ring while also doing
everything I could to minimize the privacy risks introduced into the project. 
I agree with most of the choices that the two authors came up with, and I think that the options that they listed as a response were solid options to choose from. 
Overall, I think that the responses here show how we as Christians want to look out for the hopeless and reach those who are in a tough spot. Of all of the responses I looked at,
it seemed like other students, like myself, wanted to help with stopping the ring more than they wanted to minimize the privacy risks in the open source project. 
I think that this shows the heart of Christians, and how we want to provide help and resources to those in need.
