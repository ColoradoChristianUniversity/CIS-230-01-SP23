# Prompt
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets.
 The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under 
 the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public 
 places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to
 foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Response 1 - Completion With a Twist
In this response you complete the project because you believe that the use of this tool is unenforceable. You are confident that you can contact your district representatives who will be able to help set a precedent where the enforcement of taking down religious imagery simply to "stall religious conflict" (code for 'to avoid offending others') is unenforceable.

The letters you address to your representatives will look something like this:


"Dear [Representative],

I have recently learned that [this government department] is funding a project to take down religious imagery and is intent on selling it to other countries even.

I believe their actions are infringing on the individual rights of citizens and further believe it to be in the best interest of your community to oppose the enforcement of such policy.

Thank you for your time, sincerely, [Name]."


Pros:

- You get to see your project that you've worked hard on succeed.

- You get paid for your work.

- You bring the issue to a higher level of government that was designed to protect us from stuff like this.


Cons:

- Your pursuit of mamon may subtly destroy you from within as all the things you know and love whither before your love of material gain.

- The plan representative plan might not work.


Core Value:



if we can make it, it's only a matter of time until other countries make it. the gov will waste our money anyways so it's not a real waste of money.
