# Question

While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

# Option One: Refer them to help.

Pros:

* It allows professionals to get involved

* The teammate will get the help necessary

* It may save a life

Cons:

* The teammate refuse to recieve help

* The teammate might not be able to contribute to the team

Script: 

Me: Hey I know people who can help and give you the support you need.

Teammate: Could you get me in contact with them? That would be really nice.

Me: Yes, of course, here you go.

Scripture:

Galations 6:2 "Carry each otherâ€™s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ."

First Principle: We are called to have compassion and help others out. We should share their burdens so that we can care for them.

# Option Two: Personally take time after work to be with that teammate and show them love and support.

Pros:

* You can create a better relationship with that teammate and help him/her in their life

* You can show your personal support to them by spending time with them

* They may feel loved because I personally take time out of my day to help them

Cons:

* They may not recieve the professional help that they need

* I might not be able to provide adequate help to them

* I might be taking on something that I should not be

Script:

Me: Hey I would be willing to help you and give you the support you need.

Teammate: Thank you I appreciate that. What would that look like?

Me: We could meet after work and talk through things and relieve some stress.

Teammate: that would be great thank you.

Scripture: 

Hebrews 13:16 "And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased."

First Principle: Share you time and space with others when you have it. It pleases the Lord.

# Option Three: Go to my boss about the situation and see what they want to do.

Pros:

* My boss is made aware of the situation

* The decision now lies on my bosses shoulders

Cons:

* My teammate could be very upset with me if they wanted it to be confidential

* It could cause us to lose one of our biggest clients if we have to hault the project

* It could cause large problems between me and my teammate

Script:

Me: Hey boss, (teammate) expressed to me that they are suffering from debilitating depression. I wanted to bring this to you because of the severity of the project we are working on right now.

Boss: Thank you for letting me know. No project or amount of money is as important as (teammates) health and life.

Me: Those were my thoughts as well. Thank you for taking time to consider this.

Scripture: 

Hebrews 6:10 "God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them."

First Principle: It is important to remember we are on this earth to serve. Jesus was the perfect example of servant leadership and we should follow his example.

# Conclusion

This is a tricky situation. Depression is a very serious topic and can be hard to decipher what the right thing to do it. It puts a lot of pressure on you when you company is also in a time crunch for a big project.
The situation at hand is very serious and I believe that a life is worth more than a client and money. Now whether or not it was to that point is unclear. 
However I do believe it is important to be able to be willing to help others in their times of need. 

I personaly think that helping them get to professionals and get the adequate help is the best thing to do in this situation.

# My Choice

The option I would choose would be option one. I would like to refer them to professionals who know what to do and how to help them in the best way possible. 
Also with this situation The company would most likely be able to continue with the product and hopefully keep their large customer. Depression is most certainly not something to be messed with.
That is why I believe option one is the best and will best suit this certain situation.
