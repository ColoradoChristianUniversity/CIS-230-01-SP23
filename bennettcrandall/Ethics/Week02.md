# Question

While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

# Option One: Talk to your boss to see if this is a project your company wants to take on.

Pros:

*Makes sure that your boss knows your company would be the reason for 175 people losing their job.

*Allows more people than just yourself to get in on the thinking of this project.

*Brings more attention to the seriousness of the project.

Cons:

*The boss could simply not care.

*There may be to much money on the line for the boss to turn it down.

Script:

Me: Hello sir, I was reviewing the project I was assigned to and I ran accross a part where it says 175 employees will be laid off after the completion of this product. Are you sure we want our company to be the cause of this?

Boss: Thank you for bring more attention to this. We will have to look further into the situation. We, as a company, do not want to be seen as the reason for 175 people losing their jobs.

Scripture:

Ephesians 4:32 "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.

First principle: It is essential that we are kind and compassionate to all people not causing them pain or distress.

# Option two: Confront the customer about the consequences of laying off 175 employees.

Pros:

*The customer may realize that it is best not to lay off 175 employees.

*The customer may respect us for caring about others lives and jobs.

*We will not be the reason for 175 people losing their job.

Cons:

*The customer could stop working with us.

*The customer could give us a horrible review and make us look terrible.

*We could lose lots of money.

Script:

Me: Hello, I have noticed that the completion of this product would result in 175 of your employees being laid off. Are you totally aware of this and how it will affect your company and ours?

Customer: Yes we are fully aware. We are willing to make our company much more efficient at the cost of our employees.

Me: Noted. I will talk with my boss about the continuation of this product.

Scripture:

Luke 17:3 "So watch yourselves. If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them."

First Principle: It is important to confront something that you see as wrong.

# Option 3: Asked to be assigned to a different project.

Pros:

*I no longer have to deal with the problem.

*I can focus my attention to a different project.

*I will be able to work more efficiently.

Cons:

*I could get denied permission to a different project.

*I could be seen as running from problems.

*It could affect my work reputation for the worse.

Script:

Me: Hello sir, I have noticed that the project I am working on would lay off 175 employees. I am not sure I want to be a part of that is there any way I could get assigned to a different project?

Boss: Why is being a part of that not something you want to do. It is a great opportunity for you.

Me: I do not see me being a part of 175 people losing their job as a great opportunity and I believe that I could be used elsewhere. 

Boss: Very well, we will reassign you as soon as possible.

Scripture:

Romans 12:2 "Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will."

First Priciple: It is important to be set apart from this world and make God known.

# Conclusion:

The dilemma that I am faced with is being a part of a product that would result in the laying off of 175 employees of our customer. It is hard for me to believe that I would feel okay being a part of that.
I do understand that the world is moving in a direction where AI or machines of some sort will take over many jobs. However, building something that makes 175 people supporting their families lose their jobs is something I do not want to stand for.
If I were on the end of the 175 employees I would feel betrayed and lost without a job. 

Overall, I think that building a product to lay off 175 employees would not sit right with me. 

# My Choice:

Out of the three choices above I would choose the first option. I would talk to my boss about whether or not our company wants to be a part of this.
I think this would allow me to have a one on one conversation with my boss and allow for a good conversation where I could voice my opinions with also hearing what my boss has to say.
This conversation could give me the opportunity to explain my morals and beliefs and start a gospel conversation with my boss. Having my boss be aware of the situation and how I feel is the best choice in this situation.
I think that allowing my boss to see the impact this product could have would allow him/her to rethink being a part of it.
All in all, I truly think option one is the best choice.
