While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employer’s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

# Option One: Hand off the problems to a colleague to be solved by them.

Pros:

*I do not have to deal with the conciousness of solving problems for a porn company.

*I do not have to get involved with the higher ups, it is simply just passed on.

*I can put my work towards something else.

Cons:

*I could get in trouble for not telling the higher ups it has been passed on.

*It could affect my career for the worse.

Script:

Me: Hey I do not feel comfortable solving the problems to help a porn company, if you feel comfortable would you mind taking it?

Colleague: Hey I totally understand, I would be willing to take on the problems.

Me: Okay thank you.

Scripture:

1 Peter 2:20 "But how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God."

First Principle: It is important to stick to your morals in the workplace.

# Option Two: Confront the higher up who assigned you the work.

Pros:

*It would provide direct communication between the two it involves.

*I would be able to voice my concerns about not sticking to my morals.

*My higher up would now know my morals and not assign me work related to such things.

Cons:

*It could affect the work I am give in the future

*It could ruin my relationship with my higher ups.

Script:

Me: Hello sir, the assingment I was given for the porn company is against my morals. I do not believe it is ok for me to solve the problems and benefit a porn company.

Boss: Hey I totally understand man, thank you for bringing this to my attention.

Me: Yeah no problem thank you for understanding.

Boss: Yeah no problem we will get you other work for this week.

Scripture:

James 4:17 "If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them."

First Principle: It is always best to confront and tell the truth than hide in fear.

# Option Three: I could quite if they do not reassign me.

Pros:

*I would not have to benefit a porn company.

*I would keep my personal dignity and stick to my morals.

Cons: 

*I would lose my reputation in the workplace.

*I would not be able to use them for a reference for a future job.

Script:

Me: Hey if you do not reassign me I do not think I can go through with it and I will have to quit.

Boss: We are not going to reassign you, you have to work on the problems assigned to you.

Me: Okay, I am sorry then. I have to quit.

Boss: Understood.

Scripture: 

1 Corithians 15:33 "Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good character.”

First Principle: To stand for your morals is to do the right thing.

# Conclusion:

The dilemma I am dealing with is resolving problems for a porn company making their life much more efficient and profitable. If it were a different company it would not be such a big deal.
However, it is a well-known port website and I simply can not stand for that. I would have to go home and tell my mother that I just solved problems for a porn website and made it more accessible and profitable.
I personally would not like to be on that end of a porn websit. Porn all around is horrible and corrupts the mind and destroys humans and families. 

Overall, I believe that if I were to go through with solving the problems for the porn website it would be completely unethical. It would lead to so many things that I do not want to be apart of.

# My Choice
Out of the three choices above I would choose choice two: confront the higher up who assigned you the work. This would allow for me to voice my concerns directly to my boss.
From there we would be able to have a discussion on why I believe it was against my morals. This could also lead to a gospel discussion were I would be able to share with my boss who may not be a believer.
I also believe direct conforntation is usually the best way to go. No middle men just direct discussion. All in all, I believe that option two is the best choice.
