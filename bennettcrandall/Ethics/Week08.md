# Question While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

# Option One: Let him recieve the credit

Pros:

* The teammate gets a raise

* Hopefully he is able to succeed

* The teammate will be happy

Cons:

* The company may be waisting money

* You don't get the credit you deserve

* The teammate is going to be given more responsibility that he cannot handle.

Script:

Me: Hey congrats on your raise man.

Teammate: Thank you, I could not have done it without you.

Scripture: 

2 Corinthians 10:17-18 "But, 'Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.' For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends."

First Principle: When taking credit, you should remember to only take credit of the work you have done and give the credit and glory to God.

# Option Two: Confront Company leadership

Pros:

* You get credit for your work

* Company leadership realizes that your teammate may not be as up to par as they thought

* Company leadership may give you a raise

Cons:

* Company leadership may not believe you

* Company leadership could be upset with you

Script:

Me: Hey, I noticed that my teammate who I have been mentoring is up for a raise. Is there a reason why?

Company leadership: Yes! He has been doing fantastic and his work is helping us in many way. We think he should recieve credibility for his work.

Me: I do not mean to bring my teammate down, but he has not been doing great. Most if not all the work you are seeing is mine and my teammate is really not understanding what is going on.

Company leadership: Oh, we had no idea. We thought he was doing great. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

Me: Yes, no problem.

Scripture:

Ephisians 4:25 "Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body."

First Principle: It is important to hold people accountable and also make sure credit is given where credit is due.

# Option Three: Confront the teammate

Pros: 

* You won't be going behind his/her back

* You can talk directly to them about the situation

* You can ask them to go to company leadership and be truthful

Cons:

* Your teammate may think they deserve the credit

* Your teammate may do anything to get that raise

* Your teammate may not care about honesty and being truthful

Script:

Me: Hey (teammate), I noticed you are up for a raise. What do you think about that?

Teammate: It's awesome! I am so pumped and glad that I am getting the recognition I deserve.

Me: To be honest man, I am not sure that is completely truthful. I am still mentoring you and most of the work turned in is mine. I am not sure it is fair for you to take credit for all of it.

Teammate: I mean, I suppose you are right. I am sorry, I did not even think about that. What should I do.

Me: I would appreciate it if you went to company leadership and told them the truth. I am not asking for anything else other than company leadership knows the truth.

Teammate: I think you are right. I will do that. Thank you for holding me accountable.

Scripture:

James 4:17 "If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesnâ€™t do it, it is sin for them."

First Principle: It is important to do what is right and truthful. If you know the truth it is important to stand by the truth.

# Conclusion
The enigma that I was put in for this situation was tricky. Confronting others can be hard. It can also be hard to see someone else recieve credit for something that you did.
In life it is important to stand true to your morals and also to use discernment in situations. I personally believe that confrontation is a huge win in life.
I am usually very good with confrontation and doing it in a loving way. If you are to confront someone it is important to be kind and understanding of their view as well.

All in all, this situation was tricky but can be delt with accordingly with the right confrontation.

# My Choice
Personally I would choose the thrid and final option that I gave. I would confront my teammate directly. I think it would be unfair of me to go straight to the company leadership without first talking directly with me teammate.
I think that by talking with my teammate first I would be able to ask him kindly to be truthful and see where his/her heart is at. If they are unwilling to be truthful then I would tell them I am going to company leadership because I believe in being truthful.
Out of that conversation could possibly bloom a gospel conversation which would be awesome. I think that if I were to confront my teammate they would understand and be truthful.

That is why I would choose option three as my approach to this situation.
