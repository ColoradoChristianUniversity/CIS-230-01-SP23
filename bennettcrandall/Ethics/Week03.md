# Question

While maintaining a very popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

# Option One: Ask the authorities contacting me if there is a different way to gather the evidence.

Pros:

*Allows one on one contact and conversation with the authorities.

*Maybe shows the door to a alternative solution.

*Could make the authorities think about another solution.

Cons:

*They could go to a different Open-Source.

*You could get a bad reputation.

Script:

Me: Hello, I see that you want me to introduce back door code as a solution to finding evidence. Do you think there is any other alternative solution?

Authorities: There may be, however we would rather use back door as that would be much easier and more efficient.

Me: I would be happy to supply ethical code to gather evidence, however I am not sure back door code is the way to go.

Authorities: Thank you for your time, we will look elsewhere.

Scripture:

Romans 12:17 "Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone."

First Principle: Two wrongs do not make a right. It is important to overcome evil with good and not with evil. 

# Option Two: Pray about it.

Pros:

*Allows communion with God over the subject.

*Allows for direct intervention of God.

*Can bring peace over you .

Cons:

*God may not answer in a hasty time.

Script:

Me: God, thank you for the opportunity to do what I love day in and day out. I have been approached with an opportunity to gather evidence to stop an oline child trafficking scheme.
However, I believe it may be in a way you do not approve. Provide me insight into the situation I am in.

God: ...silence...

Me: I will say no unless told otherwise by You.

Scripture:

1 John 5:14-15 "This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him."

First Principle: It is important to understand that God may not answer our prayers immediately. He hears them and may trust us to make the right decision. 

# Option Three: Say yes.

Pros:

*Makes you Open-Source more popular.

*Give you a great reputation with those authorities.

*You help get evidence to stop child trafficking.

Cons:

*It may be unethical.

*God sees what you do.

Script:

Me: Yes. I will introduce back door code to help stop online child trafficking.

Authorities: Great! Let us know when it has been introduced.

Me: No problem.

Scripture:

Proverbs 15:32 "Those who disregard discipline despise themselves, but the one who heeds correction gains understanding."

First Principle: It is a troublesome topic to stop bad with bad. Sometimes we justify it even though it may not be right.

# Conclusion:

The problem here is a tricky one. Being asked to introduce back door code to stop an online child trafficking scheme seems to me like an automatic yes.
However, when I look at it closely I get conflicting thoughts. It really comes down to believing and trusting in God. I would have to take a deeper look as to what the Bible says about a situation like the one in front of me.
This certainly is no easy task. I am not sure I would actually feel bad for saying yes and giving back door code. However, is it the right thing to do? 

Overall, I do not think that it is perfectly ethical.

# My Choice

Out of the three choices above I would choose the first choice. I would talk to the authorities directly and ask if there is another way to gather the evidence.
I would most likely always include the second choice into my decisions in life. I believe that prayer is powerful and should be used as it wields power. 
Talking directly with the authorities would most likely cause them to question why I would not introduce back door code. This would open the door for a serious discussion about why I believe fixing evil with evil is unethical.
It could lead directly into a gospel conversation that may have never happened. Actions speak louder than words and for me to show the authorities how convicted I am by my God may open their eyes to Him.
Because of these reasons I believe that option one is the best choice in this scenario.
