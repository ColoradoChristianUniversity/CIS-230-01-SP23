# Week

I chose to look at week three and see what my classmates had to say.

# Essay Summary 1

* Option one was to expose the backdoor and let others have access to it

* This allowed authorities to get the info that they needed

* Option two was to make a way for only the authorities to have access to the backdoor

* This protected the backdoor more and allowed for authorities to still stop the trafficking ring

* Option three was to deny the backdoor but still give authorities information

* This made it so there was no security risk but it was possible to still help authorities

# Their Response

This classmate's response was to do the second option

# My Response and Conclusion

Personally, I would choose the third option. This option takes away all the security risk and still gives information to the authorities.
I do not neseccarily disagree with option two but I think option three is the best option out of their responses.
Denying the backdoor but still giving as much information you can to authorities allows you to still help the situation and stay away from trouble.
So all in all I believe the third response of this classmate is the best one. 

# Essay Summary 2

* Option one was to build in the back door

* This would allow you to help the government and stop child trafficking but also a security risk

* Option two was to meet with authorities and ask questions

* This allows you to understand the project more and lets you build relationships

* Option three was to pray on the matter

* This options brings God into the work and lets you get wisdom from the wisest

# Their Response

This classmate's response was to do the third option.

# My Response and Conclusion

Out of these three options I agree with my classmate. I would choose option three. It is never a bad idea to let God intercede.
Asking for wisdom and guidence in a situation such as this will hopefully allow you to make the right decision. Bringing God into my decisions
always gives me more confidence that I am making the correct move. Therefore I believe option three is the best option out of these responses.
