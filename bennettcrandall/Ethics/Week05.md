# Question

You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, 
you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual 
property attorney who makes it very clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but 
morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:
Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own. 
The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course 
and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, 
the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation. For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such 
general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. 
In other words, students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. 
Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.
Then this
Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? 
You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. 
The writing is, so to speak, on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. 
But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. 
A lot to think about. What do you do?

# Response

# Option One: Confront the student

Pros:

* It allows me to have a private one on one conversation with them

* They could have written it themselves

* They may confess

Cons:

* I might have to fail them

* They may become angry and call me unfair

Script: 

Me: Hey I noticed your code is identical to a tutorial online. Did you copy it.

Student: Yes I did. I could not find any other solution and this one worked perfectly.

Me: This is wrong and will cause you to fail my class.

Student: I had no other solution?

Me: You can not copy code and claim it as your own. I will give you a zero on this assignment and show the class what not to do.

Student: Okay.

Scripture:

Ephesians 4:32 "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you."

First Principle: We are called to have compassion and help others out. We should forgive and learn.

# Option Two: Fail the student immediately

Pros:

* I hold to the institution's policy

* I will make sure other students do not do the same

Cons:

* I could recieve backlash from the student

* If any other student does the same I have to fail them too

* It could give me a bad reputation with students

Script:

Me: Hey I noticed your code is identical to a tutorial online. This is a direct act against the policy and I am going to have to fail you.

Student: That is ridiculous I found the right answer!

Me: I am sorry it is directly against the policy.

Scripture:

Romans 14:12 "So then, each of us will give an account of ourselves to God."

First Principle: We must hold one another accountable before God. They were in the wrong therefore we must hold them accountable.

# Option Three: Ignore it

Pros:

* The student does not fail your class

* I may not have to get in a mess with a student

* The student did find the right answer

Cons:

* Other students may start doing the same

* The one student with continue to go against the policy

(No script due to me ignoring the situation)

Scripture:

Luke 23:34 "Jesus said, 'Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.' And they divided up his clothes by casting lots."

First Principle: I do not think it is okay to ignore this situation, however it is an option.

# Conclusion

This situation is tough. When you love a student and they have the best intent in mind yet still fall short. I do not think that what they did was okay.
However, people do make mistakes and sometimes unkowingly. It would be very hard for me to fail this student within the first few weeks of class.
I would not want to be the professor who shows no grace or mercy. If the student continued to do so I would take serious action. However, in this situation I believe grace is the answer.
I would make sure the student knew he or she was in the wrong and is not able to do that again.

# My Choice

I personally would choose option one. I think that confronting the student is the best option because then I would be able to hear what they have to say.
They may have been completely unaware of what they did and the consequences that come with it. I think I would make an example of them for the class which would put that student in a hard place but it would give some sort of punishment.
I would also give the student a zero on that assignment but allow them to continue the class. I think grace is important and showing it in such a serious situation can have a large impact on people.
Overall, this situation is a hard one but option one would be my choice.
