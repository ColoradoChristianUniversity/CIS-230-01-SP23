While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1: Ask for a time extension

## Pros
* You are being communicative
* The government will be better able to decide if the problem is worth solving

## Cons
* You will not get the problem done in 2 months
* The government will be unhappy, and nobody likes an unhappy government

## Script
YOU: I am sorry but I will need an extension for this impossible problem.

GOV: We did not realize the complexity of this problem, you have six months.

## Bible Reference
> Proverbs 15:1 (NIV) "A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger."

## First Principle
Being communicative when in issue arises is better than silence or not doing the project. With the right words, there could be a compromise that would be beneficial to all parties involved.

# Response 2: Find other software that can solve the problem in 2 months, whilst using the first one to get it done in 6.

## Pros
* Would meet the requirements the government had set
* The project would get done regardless

## Cons
* Depending on the problem, it could be impossible to find
* If the project fails to be completed in time, it could lead to trouble with higher-ups.

## Script
YOU: I got the project done in 2 months.

GOV: Nice job!

## Bible Reference
> Colossians 3:23 (NIV) "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters"

## First Principle
Though it might not be possible in this scenario, looking for other means to get the problem solved is proactive. It is also being prepared in case one option fails, then there is another plan to try. 

# Response 3: Refuse to do the work until changes are made to the requirements

## Pros
* Taking a stand against unfair assignments 
* May get better treatment in the future

## Cons
* Creates tension in the workplace
* High chance of getting fired 

## Script
YOU: I refuse to do the work until you meet my demands

GOV: Ok, we will give you more time, please do not leave. Nobody else is capable of doing this problem. 

YOU: Thank you

## Bible Reference
> Titus 2:3 (NIV) "to slander no one, to be peaceable and considerate, and always to be gentle toward everyone.

## First Principle
It is plausible to take a stand for yourself and your teammates. Doing so makes it harder to be pushed around. What is important is to do it respectfully and to seek peace over trying to cause issues

# Conclusion: 
With the problem being impossible, the realistic things you can do are to talk to the higher-ups or don't. And if it takes more than 2 months to complete, you are most likely to be having a conversation regardless. So the next thing would be to decide how you want that conversation to go. 

# My Choice:
I would choose the first option as it is the best for all parties involved. You are taking initiative for something out of your control, and the managers would be happier if you brought up the issues early, rather than trying to hide them until things got bad.
