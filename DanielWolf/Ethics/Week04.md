# Conclusion:
Depression can hit everyone at different times and affect them to various degrees for a variety of reasons. It could be a major factor in the production of this project if the key player could not figure it out.

# My Choice: 
Companies might not see the value in protecting one employees mental and emotional state and go with repsonse one and tell him to work regardless. Personally, I am inclined to go with option two and help out my teammate because he is vital to the team regardless if it was this project or not. Maybe he steps away and I do extra work, but if he recovers, future projects will go smoother and the profits of the company will mostly be protected.
