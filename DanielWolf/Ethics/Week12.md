While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your preferred pronouns in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1: Claim religious exemption

## Pros
* Most likely to be beneficial 
* Lets others in the workplace know your stance
* Allows you to disagree respectfully

## Cons
* May receive backlash from co-workers

## Script
YOU: I cannot adhere to these requirements because they go against my religious beliefs

MANAGER: No worries, bless up 🙏

## Bible Reference
> Proverbs 3:6 (NIV) "in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight."

## First Principle
Have faith in God and he will lead you on the path he has set for you.

# Response 2: Take the day off

## Pros
* Little or no confliction

## Cons
* Not addressing the problem
* Lose a day off
## Script
YOU: Sorry, I will not be in on Thursday

MANAGER: No worries, have a good one

## Bible Reference
> 1 Thessalonians 5:22 (ESV) "Abstain from every form of evil."

## First Principle
Because this scenario only covers one day, it is possible to be gone for it without too many repercussions.

# Response 3: Argue against it

## Pros
* Lets everyone know your stance
* Let you take a stand for what you believe

## Cons
* Might lose dream job
* Could be disrespectful

## Script
YOU: Will not be wearing the pin or using the pronouns because they are wrong.

MANAGER: That is not good, you will be fired

YOU: Shoot 😕

## Bible Reference
> Matthew 5:11 (NIV) "Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me."

## First Principle
Arguing against the rule could lead to persecution, and could be disrespectful if done wrong. But if you are doing it for something  right, then God will bless you.

# Conclusion: 
For an individual who does not want the pin, nor supports having pronouns posted, it does not seem like there is a lot you can do to get out of it. But being wise, one could find a way to do so in a way that does not hurt others.

# My Choice:
I would go with the first choice so that I can make my stance known. This allows me to stay out of it in future events that may require me to do things I might disagree with.
