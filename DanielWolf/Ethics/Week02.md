While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1: Do the project as assigned. 

## Pros
* You keep your job

## Cons
* 175 employees lose their jobs

## Script
You: Here is the finished product

Customer: Thank you, good work

## Bible Reference
Hebrews 13:17 (NIV) "Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you."

## First Principle
You were employeed for your skill and someone else will do the job if you do not.

# Response 2: Voice your concerns with the customer

## Pros
* Could help the 175
* Could be a peaceful resolve
* Could be given another project that would be productive

## Cons
* High chances of backfiring as the customer may have already made up his/her mind

## Script
You: Hello, I think this is a great project but I am concerned for the 175 employees that risk losing thier jobs.

Customer: Though it is unfortunate, machine learning will be a better replacement

You: Though I agree that machine learning is great, I do not think it can replace these people's jobs just yet. 

Customer: Well do you have any better ideas?

You: Yes, keep the employees and instead, I cna work on a project to better train them in customer service so that more human to human contact can remain, which has been proven to be more suitable with customers in need of assistance

Customer: That sounds great, let us do that.

## Bible Reference
Acts 5:29 (NIV) "Peter and the other apostles replied: â€œWe must obey God rather than human beings!"

## First Principle
Not all people are right in their desires, and sometimes, it may be better to find a different way to accomplish things. It should be done peacefully and respectfully.

# Response 3: Refuse to do it. 

## Pros
* You stand up for the at risk employees

## Cons
* You could face high concequences

## Script
You: I will not do this project for you in concern of the fate of the employees you plan to fire

Customer: You are very bad and will be relieved of this project, I will hire your competitor to do the task you could not.

You: :pensive:

## Bible Reference
Proverbs 31:8-9 (NIV) "Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy."

## First Principle
You have the power to take out a bunch of employees and it could be considered irresponsible to ruin the lives of so many people just for a paycheck

# Conclusion:
The employees are most likely getting fired regardless of your choice. The next thing for the engineer to consider is whether they want to live with the guilt knowing that they cost the jobs of hundreds of employees. 

# My Choice: 
 I would most likely choose my first option for a couple of reasons. First, there is not a lot of information provided. For instance, we don;t know what the consultancy is for? How the machine learning improves customer efficiency over humans? What jobs the people being fired? But given what we have, there could be a multitude of reasons for the employees being fired, maybe they were not good, or the employeer/customer is just not a great boss and it would be preferable for the employees to find new employement. Finally, Those employees were gonna get fired one way or another and though it suck to be the one to start the end of their jobs, someone will do it and you might as well collect the money if that is higher value to you.
