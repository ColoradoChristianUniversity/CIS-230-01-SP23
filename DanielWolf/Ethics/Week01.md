# Scenario

While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employerâ€™s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1: Bring up my issues with the boss.

## Pros
* Good Communication between employee and administration
* Standing true with my own beliefs
* Not supporting a bad industry

## Cons
* Could get fired
* If you don't do it, someone else will

## Script
You: I can't do this project because of personal and religious beliefs
Boss: Ok, I will give this to John, thank you for bringing this up sooner rather than later. 
You: You are welcome thank you.

## Bible Reference
Ephesians 6:11 (NIV) "Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the Devil."

## First Principle
It is important to stand up for your beliefs in a professional manner so that you are not disrespecting God or his creation.

# Response 2: Act as if you are unable to fix the problem

## Pros
* People are not mad at you for your beliefs
* Might get relocated to another project

## Cons
* You are not being clear and may be asked to do stuff in the future you may also disagree with
* Could again also get fired

## Script
You: I am having trouble finding a solution to the problem
Boss: Are you incompetent?
You: No, but I think the problem is bigger than I am equipped to handle
Boss: I am disappointed, but I will pass the project on 

## Bible Reference
Matthew 5:38 (ESV) "But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also."
## First Principle
It may be weaker, but you are not allowing yourself to help benefit a negative cause

# Response 3: Build a bug

## Pros
* Potential to do great damage to evil
* Could avoid blame if done right

## Cons
* Fighting evil with evil
* Not upfront about your disdain
* Could get fired if it was found that it was you

## Script
You: I fixed the problem
*2 Years Later*
Boss: We found an issue with a project you worked on a while back. The compnay no longer exists and you are in trouble
You: What? That's crazy?
Boss: We know it was intentional and you are fired

## Bible Reference
Romans 12:21 "Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."

## First Principle
If everything were to go right, you could take down a huge player in a bad industry whilst also protecting yourself

# Conclusion:
Pornography is awful and the industry is terrible. When writing my responses to this dilemna I initially thought from a secular vs Christian standpoint. I knew I obviously did not agree with it but that is a lot like helping an alcohol or a tobacco company, two other industries I disagree with but would be willing to help if I was an engineer at a credit card company. The difference comes from the individuals who are hurt in these different industries. In an alchol or tobacco industry, the people getting hurt are the ones choosing to parttake, but because pornography involves a lot of human trafficking of both minors and adults, I could not bring myself to help them.
# My Choice: 
Either Response 1 or 3 would be good options. All of them have a possiblity of getting fired and 2 is the weakest of the bunch. With 1 you are standing up for yourself and avoiding doing something you disagree with but with 3 you are being offensive but it could result in some good despite being more risky.
