You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1: Cancel the project

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Would prevent your project from causing harm | Something you worked so hard for would not come to fruition |
| | The government agency may pull funding on future projects |

## Script
YOU: I have canceled the project

GOV: That is bad, you will receive no more support from us!

## Bible Reference
> James 4:17 (NIV), "If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesnâ€™t do it, it is sin for them."

## First Principle
You should always do what you know is right, and if you have the capabilities to protect others, then do so.

# Response 2: Find a new buyer

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Could find a better customer | Will lose main source of funding |

## Script
YOU: I am seeking a new buyer for my project

NEW BUYER: We see some ways your project could benefit society and we would like to fund it

YOU: Thank you! 

## Bible Reference
> 2 Corinthians 9:6 (NIV) "Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously."

## First Principle
Your project is a seed and your buyer will invest in it, so it is wise to choose someone who will use your project for good.

# Response 3: Seek an agreement to restrain its usage

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| If successful, would keep your project from the wrong hands | An agreement does not necessarily mean that the project won't get in the wrong hands |

## Script
YOU: I need this project to not be used for religious suppression

GOV: Yea! We can do that :wink:

YOU: Great!

## Bible Reference
> Leviticus 6:2 (NIV) "If anyone sins and is unfaithful to the Lord by deceiving a neighbor about something entrusted to them or left in their care or about something stolen, or if they cheat their neighbor"

## First Principle
Agreements are meant to work out, and if they backtrack on their word, then you are not at fault.

# Conclusion: 
The project could be used for a lot of bad things, but it can also do impressive things and should be applied in some areas of life. The goal would be to make sure that that project does not harm others. 

# My Choice:
I would go with the second option because it still lets me work while knowing my project is going toward something good.
