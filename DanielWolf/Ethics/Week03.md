While maintaining a very popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

    Note: an open source maintainer is a volunteer who basically owns a repository others contribute to. The repository, if popular, will be used in many software programs as either reference or as a library. An open source project is not owned by a company.

# Response 1: Refuse to do it

## Pros
* Protecting the work and data of users
* Not allowing for potential security breaches

## Cons
* Hindering authorities from busting a child trafficking scheme

## Script
YOU: I will not build the backdoor in fear of future consequnces

AUTHORITIES: We understand, you are hindering an investigation and are a bad person. Have a good day.

## Bible Reference
Titus 1:9 (NIV) "He must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it"

## First Principle
In this scenerio, you would be sticking up for the protection of your repository rather than opening a way for hackers to let themselves in in the future.

# Response 2: Build the backdoor

## Pros
* Helping stop a child traffic scheme

## Cons
* Compromising the security of the repository 

## Script
YOU: Here is a backdoor that you can walk in and out of with this special key

AUTHORITIES: Thank you, you have done a great service for your country and we will catch the perpetrators. You are a good person ❤️

## Bible Reference
Romans 13:1 (NIV) "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God."

## First Principle
We should listen to the authorities because God put them in place.

# Response 3: Cooperate with authorities to gather evidence on the scheme

## Pros
* Could help with the child traffic scheme 
* Could result in being able to close the backdoor

## Cons
* Might not be able to close the backdoor
* A hacker could still use it, even though the risk is significantly shorter

## Script
YOU: Here is a temporary backdoor

AUTHORITIES: Thank you for your assistance, you really should keep it open for us!

YOU: NO

AUTHORITIES: You are a mediocre person, goodbye

## Bible Reference
Philippians 2:4 (NIV) "not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others."

## First Principle
Help others when you have the means to.

# Conclusion: logos vs pathos vs ethos
You could choose to help authorities with a child trafficking, which I would think is an awful thing, scheme. But you risk compromising users of the repository you are maintaining. 

# My Choice: 
I think a lot about the Apple situation in which they would not put a backdoor in Iphone's so that the FBI could get in, even in the case of a criminial situation. They ended up resisting the FBI in order to keep them out of apple products. 
In the scenario here, I would either refuse or go with option 3 and help out, but if I chose to help, I would make sure that I kept control and locked them back out because it is a bad risk.
