While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1: Confront the pastor in private

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| There might be a reasonable explanation | The pastor could find a way to cover his tracks |
| A respectful way to start looking for answers | The pastor could get you fired | 
| Refrains from starting drama in a church by keeping it private | |

## Script
YOU: Hey I noticed you don't give to your church pastor

PASTOR: That is private information, you are fired

YOU: ðŸ˜ž

## Bible Reference
> Galatians 6:1 (NIV) "Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted."

## First Principle
Everyone messes up at some point in their lives, and it is important to first confront one on one to the best of your ability. This keeps respect within the relationship and saves the offending party from potential ostracism.

# Response 2: Talk to the accountants of the church

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| No need to confront the head pastor on your own | You are not confronting the problem head-on | 
| The accountants might have a reasonable explanation for you | They might not have an explanation, but more people are alerted to the issue |

## Script
YOU: Hey, I noticed the head pastor is not giving to the church

ACCOUNTANTS: Hmm, that is strange, we will look more into it, thank you 

## Bible Reference
> Ephesians 4:25 (NIV) "Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body."

## First Principle
The church is a team because we are all members of the body of Christ, and information that is vital to its success should go to the proper parties that can help resolve the issue.

# Response 3: Call him out during a sermon

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Expose him in front of the congregation | This is a really bad idea |
| Makes the church aware of what is going on in their church| You might be wrong |
| | It is not necessary to call him out until knowing all the facts |

## Script
YOU: You do not give your dues to the Church

CONGREGATION: GASP ðŸ˜±

PASTOR: OH NO ! ðŸ˜°

## Bible Reference
> Ephesians 5:11 (NIV) "Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them"

## First Principle
Don't let the leader of the church hide his evildoings from the church

# Conclusion: 
As a Christian, it is important to confront sin, especially in church. There are many ways to handle this situation, but because he is not directly hurting anyone with his actions, it is probably best to handle the issue behind closed doors.

# My Choice:
I would start by confronting the pastor, and if it gets resolved, then all is good. If not, then move on through the different leaders and workers of the church until a resolution is made.
