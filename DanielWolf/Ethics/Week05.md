You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it very clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:

    Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own. The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation. For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words, students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.

Then this

Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is, so to speak, on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?

# Response 1: Communicate and Give Grace, but Refuse to Accept the Assignment for Points

## Pros
* The student might not have understood, and if s/he did, they would be taught a valuable lesson.
* It would be a painless confrontation for the most part.


## Cons
* The school would not be made aware of broken conduct

## Script
Teacher: Hey, I noticed you copied this assignment and that is wrong

Student: I am so sorry, I did not realize the severity of my actions, I will do better in the future.

Teacher: That is good, unfortunantly, I cannot give you credit, but you will not get in trouble for this one assignment

Student: Thank you very much!

## Bible Reference
Colossians 3:13 (NIV) "Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you."

## First Principle
God gave us grace and we should give grace

# Response 2: Dish Out the Punishment

## Pros
* Following the school policy.

## Cons
* Student would get in-trouble and might hold a grudge

## Script
Teacher: I noticed this was plagiarised and you will be punished

Student: I am sorry :rage:

## Bible Reference
Hebrews 13:17 (NIV) "Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy, not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you."

## First Principle
Listen to the authorities

# Response 3: Grade as is

## Pros
* None

## Cons
* The student does not get an understanding for what was wrong.
* The student may apply their plagerism habits into the workforce.

## Script
Teacher: Here is an A+.

Student: Yay I am  so good at cheating :)

## Bible Reference
The Bible does not condone this behavior
James 4:17 (NIV) "If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesnâ€™t do it, it is sin for them."

## First Principle
Doing nothing would be wrong

# Conclusion: 
The teacher should atleast confront the student in one way or another so that they will get an understanding of what they are doing and how it would affect their futures. With that in mind, two approaches involve either getting the student punishes or not. 

# My Choice:
I would go for option one because we are all human and all make mistakes. And at the same time, this option allows us to grow positively.
