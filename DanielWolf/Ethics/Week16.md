You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's technically true, but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you specifically because you have access to details of the public figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking about, as they often attack Christians in public without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency and individual dignity. You also consider your belief in obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, and the right of self-preservation. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1: Refuse

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Protects confidentially of your company | Anti-Christian guy is not exposed |

## Script
YOU: I will not fulfill your request

NEWS: NOO! That is bad.

## Bible Reference
> Proverbs 11:13 (NIV) "A gossip betrays a confidence, but a trustworthy person keeps a secret."

## First Principle
People should not be able to use your position to harm others.

# Response 2: Do it

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Anti-Christian guy gets exposed | You open the door for more people to come seek information |
| Chances to expand career | You are responsible for allowing another to get slandered |

## Script
YOU: Here is the information you requested

NEWS: YES! You are a good person ðŸ˜‰

## Bible Reference
> Ephesians 5:11 (NIV) "Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them."

## First Principle
Do what you can to stop evil.

# Response 3: Give enough information to help, but not enough to harm

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Everyone gets what they want | This is Con one and this is the extra information |
| potential career advancement | A really lukewarm response that might open the door to more harassment from the news |

## Script
YOU: Here is a little information

NEWS: This is useless!

YOU: You can have some, but I will not be the reason a man gets cancelled

## Bible Reference
> Revelations 3:16 (NIV) "So, because you are lukewarmâ€”neither hot nor coldâ€”I am about to spit you out of my mouth."

## First Principle
Stand firm in your beliefs

# Conclusion: 
As Christians, we shoudl respect even those who do not respect us, even if it feels wrong. In this dilemna, you have the choice to expose information against and anti-Christian man and gain Earthly riches, or reject that offer and leave things as they are.

# My Choice:
I would chose to reject the request because it would be wrong to use private information to get a man cancelled.
