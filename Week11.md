# Question

While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer

## Option 1: Find a way to get the third-party software faster

**🟩 Pros:**

 - Allows the problem to be solved in the impossible time span
 - You do not have to ask for more time
 - Could give you a perfect solution compared to not having the software

**🟥 Cons:**

 - Could be illegal or copyright without waiting the 6 months
 - Could get you fired
 - Could lead to more problems than it fixes.

**🎭 Script:**

 - Me: Hello, is there any way to obtain this in less time than 6 months. 
 - Third-party: No, unfortunately there is no better way than to wait the full 6 months. 
 - Me: I understand.

**📖 Scripture:**

> Chronicles 15:7 (NIV) - "But as for you, be strong and do not give up, for your work will be rewarded.”

**🤔 First principle:**

It is important to do your best work for the Lord and abide by the rules. Taking the third-party software may be unethical therefore unobtainable. 

## Option 2: Ask the government authorities for more time

**🟩 Pros:**

 - Allows for the use of the third-party software
 - Allows for a better solution to the problem
 - Can most likely ensure that the problem gets solved

**🟥 Cons:**

 - Authorities could say no
 - Could lead to a bad reputation within the government

**🎭 Script:**

 - Me: Hey, I found this third-party software that can give us the solution. However, it takes 6 months minimum to obtain it. Do you think we could extend the deadline to ensure a perfect solution?
 - Authorities: We are behind that idea we will get the due date extended to 7 months if that works for you.
 - Me: Sounds great. Thank you.

**📖 Scripture:**

> Romans 13:1 (NIV) - "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God."

**🤔 First principle:**

It is important to listen and respect the government and your authorities decisions.

## Option 3: Find a different way to solve the problem in 2 months

**🟩 Pros:**

 - You do not have to talk to anyone
 - You do not have to raise any concerns pertaining to the problem
 - Can allow you to get a good reputation within the government

**🟥 Cons:**

 - Could take up the rest of your time for the next 2 months
 - Could be seemingly impossible
 - You could work for the next 2 months and not get a solution to the problem

**🎭 Script:**

 - No script due to attempting to solve it yourself.

**📖 Scripture:**

 > Colossians 3:23-24 (NIV) - "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving."

**🤔 First principle:**

It is important to do your best work with what you are given. Remember to always do your work as if you are doing it for the Lord. 

## Conclusion
This is a very tricky situation that I have been put in. It seems like an impossible decision and situation. The project itself seems impossible and where to go to make in not impossible also seems impossible.
When faced with problems such as these it is always smart to pray and seek guidance from God and those around you. In this certain scenario, it seems impossible to do anything. When I personally get in situations like the one above I can do nothing but rely on God.
I know that He has a plan in it all and that there is something to do even when there seems like nothing. You always got to take it one step at a time and God will make things fall in place. 

## My Choice

Out of the options above, I would choose Option 2: Ask the government authorities for more time. I personally feel like this would be the first step in this situation. Like I said above in the conclusion you must take situations like these one step at a time.
Talking to the authorities to make them understand how impossible the situation is may lead to solutions. There is always the chance they do not understand and they do not care about how impossible it sounds. Obviously above I made the scenario have the authorities understand which makes things a lot easier.
However, this is not always the case. But right now it is. The authorities understand and want a perfect solution so they extend the due date. For these reasons my choice is Option 2.
