Prompt: While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

---

____Option 1____ : Inform the government agency about the procurement process and ask if there are any ways to expedite it, such as seeking an emergency procurement or speeding up the approval process.

Pros: This response is straightforward and honest. It lets the agency know the realistic timeline for obtaining the software and gives them the opportunity to find a solution that works for everyone.

Cons: There may not be any way to speed up the procurement process, which means the agency may be unable to obtain the software in time to solve the problem.

Script: 
Me - To whom it may concern, I was curious if I could have more information about the procurement process and if there is any way to expedite it. There is a project that needs to be completed in a very short amount of time and with the help of your software, it will allow me and my team to solve this problem faster. However, the only thing holding us back right now is how long the procurement process takes for this software. Let me know what our options are and if there is a way to speed up this process. Thank you! :)
Government - Hello Gabe, thank you for reaching out. There may be a way to speed up this process. We can have one of our developers reach out to you and present you a few different options that will make your decision more easy.

Scripture: Luke 11:9-13 
I tell you: ask, and you shall receive; seek, and you shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you. For everyone who asks, receives; and everyone who seeks, finds; and to everyone who knocks the door will be opened.

____Option 2____ : Look for alternative solutions to the problem that do not require the third-party software.

Pros: This response shows initiative and creativity. It may also be more cost-effective than purchasing the third-party software.

Cons: The alternative solutions may not be as effective as the third-party software, and the agency may miss out on the benefits of using it.

Script: 
Me - Hey team, I am starting to realize that this problem is looking somewhat out of the realm of possibility and it is going to be difficult to try and find a solution in two months. I have thought about trying third party software, but everywhere I have looked says it is a minimum of six months to obtain the software. This leads me think more about our options and what resources we have available. I am going to request that we receive more hands on deck to find a solution and overall this may be more cost effective than purchasing new software. We got this and we will get through this!
Team - Does this mean we have to work on Saturday?
Me - possibly... 
Team - *sigh... :(

Scripture: Matthew 7:13-14 
13 â€œEnter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.

____Option 3____ : Use personal funds to purchase the third-party software and donate it to the government agency.

Pros : This response allows the agency to solve the problem in a timely manner and demonstrates dedication to the job. It also shows a willingness to go above and beyond what is expected.

Cons : Using personal funds may not be feasible for everyone, and it sets a precedent that could be difficult to maintain in the future.

Script: 
Boss - Good job on finishing up this project Gabe! That must have really taken a lot of time and effort, we really appreciate your dedication and expertise you add to this company. How did you manage to get all of this done?
Me - Well boss, I looked at our options to see what the best course of action would be to get this job done and I found this software that solved our initial problem. However, at first, I was unsure how successful this software would be so I just decided to purchase it with my own money to use it as a test run and it ended up being exactly what we needed!
Boss - Wow thats amazing! And im impressed that you bought something for company use with your own money. That shows me dedication to this organization and I want to give you a promotion.
Me - Really?? Thats great! :)

Scripture: Proverbs 21:20 
In the House of the wise are stores of choice food and oil, but a foolish man devours all he has. The simplicity behind the idea to 'spend less than you earn' is shared clearly in this verse.

____Conclusion____

In this situation, it is important to communicate honestly with the government agency about the procurement process and the realistic timeline for obtaining the third-party software. It may also be worthwhile to explore alternative solutions to the problem that do not require the software. If purchasing the software is the only viable solution, using personal funds to obtain it may be an option, but it should be approached with caution. Ultimately, the best response will depend on the specific circumstances of the situation, including the agency's budget, the urgency of the problem, and the feasibility of alternative solutions.

____My Choice____

Out of the options above, I would most likely choose the first option and if that doesn't work and I don't get the answers I need, I will pursue option two. A lot of times, software companies will help you as best as they can, but they can only do so much. If the software takes six months to procure, then thats what it takes. The third option would be ideal, but the risk to reward ratio is off and the reality may not be as fun and nice as I described with a happy boss and a new promotion. Things could have gone way worse and the software, which is most likely really expensive, could be useless and I could be out all of that money with no progress made on the problem. I believe the safest bet would be option 1 followed by option 2.
