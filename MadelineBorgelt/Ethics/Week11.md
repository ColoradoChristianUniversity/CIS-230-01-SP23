# Scenario:
While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
## Option 1: Send out emergency email, quickly explain your error and that you will fix as it is your responsibility it even if it the work leads into tomorrow is Sunday. 
### Pros:
-	Accepts full responsibility for big mistake
-	Takes responsibility to fix 
### Cons:
-	Shows you are willing to compromise on values 
-	Compromise on boundaries you set to honor the sabbath 
### Script: 
Me (in email) : I accidentally introduced a dangerous bug that is breaking to whole system. I am open to meetings tomorrow to figure out a recovery plan and will be working all night to fix what I can. 
### Scripture: 
 “Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.” - Proverbs 28:13
### First Principle: 
My first principle is based off of the above scripture, this was clearly my fault, I must take responsibility for my actions and for the solution.

## Option 2: Send an email out give a detailed description of the code you introduced that is causing the crash, let them know you cannot do anything about tomorrow, that you are deeply sorry and will address it first thing Monday.
### Pros:
-	Protects sabbath 
-	Consistent with boundaries you set prior to this incident  
### Cons:
-	Bug crashed whole system and you are leaving company in chaos
-	Creates appearance that you are not willing to fix the problem you created
-	
### Script: 
Me (in email): *detailed description of code* I accidentally introduced this and it is crashing the system I will work on it all tonight and then fix and address everything else Monday!
### Scripture:
“Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.” - Exodus 20:8-11
### First Principle:
My first principle relates to the above Bible verse, in waiting to Monday to work on the project I am honoring God’s word. 

### Option 3: Work on it all night to try to fix what you did if all fails email whoever is above you and fill them in with the situation and your attempt at resolving it and in humility let them know you cannot work tomorrow but will jump back immediately Monday morning. 

### Pros:
-	Shows you tried to fix it 
-	Assure you are taking responsibility of your actions and responsibility for the resolution as soon as it is Monday 
### Cons:
-	You understand what you did with the code better than anyone else could 
-	Could cause teammates and superiors to be upset and frustrated 
### Script:
Me (in email): *description of situation and solutions you have attempted” I am so sorry and accept full responsibility for it and will work on the resolution Monday.  
### Scripture:
“Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.” - Exodus 20:8-11
### First Principle: My first principle relates to the above Bible verse, in waiting to Monday to work on the project I am honoring God’s word. 

## Conclusion 
This is a difficult situation as honoring the sabbath does mean you are honoring God but working and fixing your mistake does not necessarily mean you are dishonoring God. 

## My choice 
Personally I would lean toward option 1 because I would feel really bad breaking the whole system and then just backing off, even if it is for just a day.
