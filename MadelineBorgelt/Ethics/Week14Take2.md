# Scenario:
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: Reach out to the product manager to understand the realistic “potential” of foreign governments actually using it and ask what preventions or precautions could be taken. 
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
|Allows you to gain more information on the likely hood and the potential consequences| No foreseeable or largely concerning cons as you are just gathering information |
| Allows you to gain opinions and insight from the product manager | - |


### Script: 
Would be none. 
### Scripture: 
A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion.” – Proverbs 18:2
### First Principle: 
My first principle is based on the above scripture, I would want to take time to understand the components and likely hood before taking more preventative action 

## Option 2: Reach out and talk to the supervisor about how the program, in general, could be seen as a violation of free speech and religious freedom. It could also be seen as a form of censorship, which could lead to further conflict and resentment among religious communities. This could be blown even up if foreign countries implement it. 

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
|Communicates specific fears| Do not see any as this is just doing a natural risk assessment |
| Shows manager you really thought through possible consequence  | - |

### Script: 
Me (to manager): “I just wanted  to talk to you as I am really concerned that licensing this to foreign governments could compound some preexisting concerns (introduce them),  I just wanted to see if I am understanding this properly.” 
### Scripture: 
A fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion.” – Proverbs 18:2
### First Principle: 
My first principle is based on the above scripture, I would want to take time to understand the components and likely hood before taking more preventative action 

### Option 3 Talk to the client and manager and suggest that maybe instead of using the program to identify and remove religious references from public places, it could be used to identify patterns or trends in religious references and provide insights for policymakers to make informed decisions. 

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
|This would allow the government agency to achieve its goals without compromising on free speech and religious freedom | Client might not want this |
| Shows concern and viable solution | You already completed the project – should have shifted the scope earlier  |

### Script:
Me – set up a meeting with the manager and introduce this idea and see if it would be possible to move forward and whether he think this possible and viable alternative. 
### Scripture:
“Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.” – Proverbs 11:13
### First Principle: My first principle relates back to the Bible verse above; it is good to hear the wisdom and advice of others before taking action – although this is a solution to a degree I am not aware of how realistic it would so It would be wise to consult my manager. 

## Conclusion 
This is a difficult situation because you already created this program that introduces some moral qualms – forging or close to home this program could have backlash and negative effects. 

## My choice 
I would choose option 3: Talk to the client and manager and suggest that maybe instead of using the program to identify and remove religious references from public places, it could be used to identify patterns or trends in religious references and provide insights for policymakers to make informed decisions.
