# Prompt: 
You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's technically true, but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you specifically because you have access to details of the public figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking about, as they often attack Christians in public without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency and individual dignity. You also consider your belief in obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, and the right of self-preservation. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: Tell the agency what they want to hear.

Me: I'm sorry, I can't do that. It goes against my personal ethics to disclose confidential information about certain people.

News Agency: But we really need this information for our story. It's important for the public to know.

Me: I understand, but I can't compromise my integrity and violate the trust that people have placed in me.

News Agency: We'll find someone else who's willing to help us. Thanks anyways.

| **游릴 Pros:**     | **游린 Cons:**       |
| ----------| ----------  |
| Uphold my moral values while still fulfilling my professional responsibilities     | Might not satisfy the agency's wants and needs, which could harm my relationship with them.       |

| Might be able to negotiate with the agency and find a mutually beneficial solution.     | Might not gain the benefits I would get from the first option, such as career advancement or recognition.      |

Me: I'm happy to help, but I need to be upfront with you that I have ethical and legal obligations to some people that I can't break.

News Agency: We understand. Can you provide us with any information that would be relevant to our story?

Me: I can tell you that (random public figure) *disclose information, but not any that could harm (random public figure). 

News Agency: That's pretty vague, but we'll take what we can get. Thanks for your help.

**游닀 Scripture:**

## Conclusion
It is important to note that honesty, integrity, and ethical behavior are essential qualities of a responsible and successful professional, and that short-term gains should not come at the expense of your long-term reputation and well-being. At the end of the day, a professional needs to determine his or her values up front before making potentially life altering decisions.

## My Choice

Out of the options above, I would most likely choose the second option which is refusing to provide the agency with the information they're seeking. I believe it is best to stay out of potentially sketchy situations that have the slightest chance of becoming a legal problem. Yes, giving information could affect my career positively, but for how long? When there is any possibility of harming another's professional career to benefit mine, the in itself seems like the wrong thing to do regardless.
