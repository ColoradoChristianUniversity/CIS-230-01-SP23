# Question

You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: Pray about it

| **游릴 Pros:** | **游린 Cons:** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Allows you to bring God into your decision | God could not answer in time |
| Hopefully relieves stress by giving it to God | Might have to do something immediately | 
| God can guide you in your decision |  |

**游꿠 Script:**

 - Me: Hey God, I'm in a sticky situation. I know you know it. What do I do? I need your guidance. I've worked so hard for this; but is it right? Help.
 - God: I do not think you should let this go without standing for me.
 - Me: Okay.

**游닀 Scripture:**

> 1 John 5:14 (NIV) - "This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us."
**游뱂 First principle:**

It is important to listen to what God says and follow His commands and wants for you.

## Option 2: Confront your product manager

| **游릴 Pros:** | **游린 Cons:** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Allows for a one on one conversation with your manager on your concerns | Your product manager might not care |
| Brings the problem to a trustworthy person | The manager may not respect what you have to say | 
| Allows you to be confidential | Could give you a bad reputation in the workplace |

**游꿠 Script:**

 - Me: Hey, I've heard what this software is going to be used for and that just doesn't sit right with me. No matter what your belief is, this is a free country and we shouldn't be monitoring religious references. 
 - Prodcut Manager: We don't care. This software is amazing and is going to make us so much money. It isn't a big deal if a few religious things get taken down.
 - Me: I'm not sure I feel right or comfortable with that.
 - Product Manager: Well, I'm not sure what to tell you. We are going through with it and you can either make a lot of money or walk away.
 - Me: Okay.

**游닀 Scripture:**

> Galations 6:1 (NIV) - "Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted."
**游뱂 First principle:**

It is important to be restored in the Spirit so that you are not caught in sin because you will be tempted. 

## Option 3: Ignore what it will be used for

| **游릴 Pros:** | **游린 Cons:** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| It could be used for good as well | Could serve consequences from God |
| You could make a lot of money | Could be ridiculed by fellow believers | 
| You won't get in trouble and won't taint your reputation | May not be the light for God you should be | 

**游꿠 Script:**

- No script due to ignoring what the software you worked so hard for will be used for. 

**游닀 Scripture:**

 > Proverbs 16:3 (NIV) - "Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans."
**游뱂 First principle:**

It is important to focus your work to the Lord. If you do everything for the Lord and do it to the best of your ability He will establish the plans He has for you.

## Conclusion

What an interesting situation this is. I think this might be one of the hardest ethics situations yet. I really sat thinking for awhile on this one. I do not see a ton of options. If I am being completely honest with myself I think I would try and focus soley on the software and making it work how it is supposed to work.
I think software people create can be used for good and bad in a lot of situations. So with this certain enigma I believe there could be a lot of good that comes out of this software development and the machine learning tool. 
Hearing that it may be used to make the public more secular is hard to hear. But what if it was used elsewhere like in churches or Christian schools to help. That is why I think I would do my best on the development team to create a near perfect software program.
Then I would put the rest in God's great hands.

## My Choice

Out of the options above, I would choose Option 3: Ignore what it will be used for. I think this option is the best soley because it could be used for good as well. Software can be used by just about anyone when it is for sale unless there are restrictions obviously. Therefore, no matter what kind of software development you are in your software could possibly be used for bad.
That doesn't mean you should quit software. That just means make the best possible software you can and leave the rest to God. Now making the best software possible may mean making restrictions within that software that prohibits bad behavior with it. Sometimes it is inevitable.
These reasons are why I am choosing Option 3.
