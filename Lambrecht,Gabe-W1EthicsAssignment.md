Prompt: While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employer’s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. 
Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses?  What do you do?

____Option 1____ : Do whats best for the Credit Card Company and do what the customer wants.

Pros:  
The chance of termination would be low.
I would look good to my boss in the sense that I am willing to work on any project.

Cons: 
There will be a chance of termination if I were to decline his or her request for working on a site that directly impacts a company that does not align with my morals.

Script: Customer: My company is experiencing trouble with Credit Card information on our website and I would like your developers to come up with a solution to fix my sites issues. Finding a solution to my problem would not only relieve my frustrations, but it would also increase my company's profits.
Me: Sure thing, working on finding a solution to your problem would benefit my employer and our company in general. We will work to find a solution to your problem.
Customer: Thank you!


Romans 13 1
Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.

____Option 2____ : Have the conversation with your employer about how this project goes against my morals and beliefs and request that someone else works toward a solution.

Pros: Have open and transparent beliefs so that everyone knows so when it comes to deciding who will work on a project like this, my employer will already know that I wont be comfortable working on the project.

Cons: Possible termination for not being willing to work on any project that the company receives.

Script: Customer:  Customer: My company is experiencing trouble with Credit Card information on our website and I would like your developers to come up with a solution to fix my sites issues. Finding a solution to my problem would not only relieve my frustrations, but it would also increase my company's profits.
Boss : Sure thing! Gabe, from our conversation earlier, I know that your religious beliefs hinder your ability to work on a project like this so I understand if you are not willing to work on this. Would you like me to find someone else to start this assignment?
Me : Thank you for considering my beliefs and moral when deciding who to choose for this project. I do not feel comfortable working on a project that enables a serious addiction that so many people have. If you have another project I can start, I will work on it right away!

Scripture: Galatians 6:7 “Don't be misled, you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant”. Allowing another to suffer those consequences is, in effect, partnering with God.

____Option 3____ : Leave the company.

Pros: Wouldn't have to work for a company that accepts work like this.
Have another chance at finding a job that values Christian morals and ethics and chooses jobs that benefit humanity.



Cons : Finding a job that values Christian morals and ethics is hard to come by.
It was hard finding this job, how can I find another that has similar benefits to this one.


Script:
Customer: My company is experiencing trouble with Credit Card information on our website and I would like your developers to come up with a solution to fix my sites issues. Finding a solution to my problem would not only relieve my frustrations, but it would also increase my company's profits.
Boss : Sure thing! Gabe, can you start working on this project?
Me : Im sorry boss, but I have to decline. Also, I am putting in my two week notice today. I do not like the idea of working for a company that contributes to working on sites that negatively harm the lives of millions of people. Thank you for this opportunity.

Scripture: 1 Corinthians 16:13 "Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.

____Conclusion____

It is important for an employee to perform their job that satisfies the needs of their team and or boss. However, there are times were someone is put into a situation that is morally and ethically difficult to make. Contributing to a well-known pornography website would be enabling millions of people to continue in un Godly behavior and pornography is known to ruin the lives and love that young people have. If I were to help this customer, their company would continue to benefit off of millions of people in a negative way and that would not be glorifying to God.

____My Choice____
Out of the options above, I would personally choose option 2. There are many other consequences that could happen to me if I refuse to do a service for a customer. I could get fired or written up. If I deny and the customer, it could make the company look bad in the public eye which will drive away future customers. It would be morally wrong for me to work on a project like this, so having the healthy conversation with my employer and explaining that as a Christian, enabling people to continue in addiction to porn is wrong and it would be very hard for me to do. It allows my boss to consider other employees in the company that can work on this project.
