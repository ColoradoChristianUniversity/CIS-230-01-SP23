# Question: 
## Situation setup:
You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, 
you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney 
who makes it very clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. 
In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:

> Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the
> work of others as your own. The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. 
> Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported. 
> If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, 
> the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation. For this class, it is permissible to assist
> classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however,
> must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words,
> students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. 
> Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) 
> another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.

## Then this:

Just a week or two into class, 
one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. 
Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. 
The writing is, so to speak, on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. 
But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. 
A lot to think about. What do you do?

# Response 1:  Discipline the student

## Pros:
- Follows correctly with the school's guidelines
- Keeps integrity to other students, showing that it will not be tolerated

## Cons:
- the student will probably not be a huge fan of you after this

## Script:
Professor: "I apologize, but it is clear that this code was copied. I am left with no choice but to take the proper measures for discipline."
The student realistically could respond in a number of ways, maybe out of anger, or try to explain themselves, or something else.

## Scripture: Proverbs 21:15 "When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers."

## First Principle: As Christians, we should follow the rules of the institutions that we are under, because we have agreed to be in those institutions.

# Response 2: Warn the student, without discipline

## Pros:
- The student will probably be very grateful of your mercy
- The student should still learn their lesson

## Cons:
- Does not follow the rules of the school
- Could cause other students to think that you will have mercy on them as well.

## Script:
Professor: "Look, I know you copied this code. I won't report it to the school, but if I ever see something like this again, I will not hesitate to report it."
Student: "I appriciate your mercy, I promise it won't happen again."

## Scripture: Titus 3:5 "“He saved us, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness, but in virtue of his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit.”

## First Principle: As Christians, we recognize that God first gave us mercy, so we may give mercy to others. 

# Response 3: Question the student and talk to them about it

## Pros:
- Starts a discussion
- Allows the student to explain themselves

## Cons:
- Does not follow what the institution would want you to do
- Leaves a chance that the other students would think that they can copy with no reprecussions

## Script:
Professor: "Looking at your code, I'm noticing that it looks like you copied it from this tutorial. Would you mind explaining yourself?"
The student would hopefully have a good reason for copying the code, and could have a discussion with you about it.

## Scripture: Ephesians 2:4-5 “But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ — by grace you have been saved.”


## First Principle: As Christians, it's clear that we should try to understand people where they are and love them, which can also mean mercy for those in a tough spot.


# Conclusion: Personally, if I were the professor, I would go with the second option. I would make it very clear to the student that while I understand they may have had
some sort of situation where they needed to copy, whether they ran out of time or had some other life circumstances, the behaviour would not be tolerated again. 
I would also try to understand the student and at least see where they were coming from. That way, I have the full picture of the situation, while still being firm
with them.
