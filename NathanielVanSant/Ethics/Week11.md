# Question

While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer

## Option 1: Explain to your higher ups the situation, and see about an extension of time.

**Pros:**

 - Hopefully gets you the time to get the software
 - Problem gets solved if they extend your time
 - Could work on other projects in the meantime

**Cons:**

 - Goes way over time limit if they extend it
 - If they don't extend the time, you're sort of out of luck.

**Script:**

 - Me: "Hey. I found a solution to this problem with some third party software. But it may take a lot longer than the dealine in order to get the software. Is there any chance for an extension?
 - Boss: "We can talk to the teams and see about it, thanks for letting me know."

**Scripture:**

> Ephesians 5:15-17 - “Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.”

**First principle:**

It is usually good to take the time in order to do something the right way.

## Option 2: Attempt to solve the project on your own.

**Pros:**

 - Finish on time
 - No need to ask for extensions or anything 

**Cons:**

 - You may not solve it
 - Could cause you to lose a lot of reputation or position in your job, due to failure to complete what was assigned.
 
**Script:**

- You: "Hey, here's what I have for this problem. I must admit though, with the time given I wasn't able to fully solve this.
- Boss: "Alright, I'm hoping for your sake that this will be good enough for this project..."

**Scripture:**

> 2nd Chronicles 31:21 "And every work that he undertook in the service of the house of God and in accordance with the law and the commandments, seeking his God, he did with all his heart, and prospered."

**First principle:**

Getting things done when told to do them always turns out well

## Option 3: Ask higher ups regarding the best course of actions

**Pros:**

 - Leaves the decision out of your hands
 - Whatever they choose will not frustrate them
 - Probably gets the problem solves either way

**Cons:**

 - You would need to give up your control
 - Can cause frustration if they feel you are delegating your problems to them.

**Script:**

 - You: "Hey, I have found some third party software to use for this problem, and it should mean we can actually solve it, however it will take a while to aquire the software. What should we do?"
 - Boss: "Not sure, I'll ask the other managers what they think is best and get back to you."

**Scripture:**

 > Proverbs 12:15 - "Prov. 12:15,“The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise."

**First principle:**

We should seek advice with hard problems, especially when it's your boss!

## Conclusion

Out of these options, I would choose the third option. The reason for this is that although I would be tempted to solve the problem myself regardless of what they think,
it is almost always better to make sure what you intend to do is ok with your boss, or to see what they would think the best course of action is. 
This way, instead of picking an option and hoping that it's what they would want, you can directly ask and make sure that whatever course of action is taken it's
what is wanted by all involved with the leadership.
