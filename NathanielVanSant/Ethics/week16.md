# Question

You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's technically true,
but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you specifically because you have access to details of the public 
figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking
about, as they often attack Christians in public without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency and individual dignity. 
You also consider your belief in obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, and the right of self-preservation.
What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer

## Option 1: Decline to provide information

| Pros | Cons |
|------|-----|
| You won't contribute to cancel culture | Leaves the chance to freely give justice to someone who might deserve it |
| Leaves the person to have whatever natural concequences may come | Feels a little bit "laissez-faire", in the way that you could do something about this person but do nothing |
|  | Could leave room for this perosn to continue being a bad person |

**Script:**
Me: "Look, I realize that we want to get some dirt on this person, but I don't think I can provide anything for you."
Agency: "Dang, we were really hoping you had something for us..."

**Scripture:**

>  Romans 12:19 - "Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.'"

**First principle:**
As Christians, we should leave God to do justice rather than seeking vengeance ourselves.

## Option 2: Give out the information

| Pros | Cons |
|------|-----|
| Gets dirt on someone you don't like | The statement the agency has may not even be true, so it could be spreading false information |
| Possibly gets this person cancelled so that they cannot continue doing bad things, assuming what they did was true. | This is seeking vengeance for yourself which can get out of hand |

**Script:**
Me: "Alright I can get you the information..."
Agency: "Good - just wait and see where we can land their reputation!"

**Scripture:**

> Isaiah 1:17: "Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause."

**First principle:**

We should try to seek justice for those who have done wrong, assuming it is confirmed true.

## Option 3: Try to confirm the truth about it, and decide from there


| Pros | Cons |
|------|-----|
| Takes the time to confirm what really happened | Could spend a lot of time on this, which may not be worth it. |
| Allows for the truth to give an answer rather than blid decision |  |

**Script:**

Me: "Let me look on what I can find about them. I want to make sure this claim is true before I pin it on this person."
Agency: "Well make it fast..."

**Scripture:**

 > Leviticus 19:15 - "You shall do no injustice in court. You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor."
 
**First principle:**

We should try to act in candor, and find the truth before acting hastily.

## Conclusion

Out of these options, I would choose the first option. In my opinion, usually these matters tend to be pretty one sided or the other - a blame game where you pick a side. By not releasing the information to the
agency, you ensure that nobody is falsely accused, and you stay out of it, rather than picking a side. This can leave it up to God to punish the public figure if they have done wrong, and does not contribute to toxic
cancel culture that has plagued our society. In this way, you can stay out of it and not give the agency "dirt" in order to wreck someone's life on something that may not even be true.
