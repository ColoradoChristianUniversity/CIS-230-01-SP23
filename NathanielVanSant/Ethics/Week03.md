# Question

While maintaining a very popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1: Expose the backdoor

## Pros:
- Stops the ring
- Enables the authorities to get all needed info

## Cons:
- Leaves a lot of software vulnerable with a backdoor
- Could be considered immoral to leave security faults in your own project

## Script:
Me: Alright, I've left a backdoor in the code, and here's how to access it..."
Authorities: "Thank you, we will be sure this ring gets stopped."

## Scripture:
"Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and oppressed." - Psalm 82:3

## First Principle:
Christian people should know when to fight for those who can't fight for themselves, and help the oppressed.

# Response 2: Create a way for the authorities to be the only ones who can access a backdoor, and document the backdoor.

## Pros:
- Stops the ring
- Enables the other users of the open source project to be aware of the backdoor

## Cons:
- Still creates a security risk, especially since the awareness is already spread that the backdoor exists.
- Could cause users or other developers of the project to become unhappy with your choise.

## Script:
Other Dev: Hey, why would you add this backdoor to the code? It's a real risk, and I'm not sure I want to use the project anymore.
Me: It's because of the trafficking ring that the authorities can shut down, though I understand that there are security risks here...

## Scripture:
"The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’" Matthew 25:40

## First Principle:
The Lord will always want us fighting for those who are oppressed and the least of us.

# Response 3: Deny the backdoor but still provide as much information to the authorities as you can.

## Pros:
- Leaves the project with no security risks
- Still gets the authorities some information that can help them
- Possibly shuts down the ring

## Cons:
- It's possible that the authorities won't get enough info to shut the ring down.

## Script:
Me: Alright, I've got the information for you here.
Authorities: This will be a good start, thanks for the help, though we wish you could have done more for us.

## Scripture:
"Blessed are those who have regard for the weak; the LORD delivers them in times of trouble." Psalm 41:1

## First Principle:
We, as Christians, should always have regard for the weak and do something to help in any way we can.

# Conclusion:
Personally, I would try and execute the second response. This would involve creating a special way for the authorities to access your code, while still not leaving as large of a security risk in the code.
Even though this option could be difficult to pull off, I believe it is the best option, because it still shuts the ring down, and it also leaves protection for the project to an extent. Personally, in this situation,
I would always be prioritizing getting the ring shut down, even if it means hurting the project.
