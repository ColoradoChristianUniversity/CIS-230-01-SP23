# Question

While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1: Refuse the project

## Pros:
- Help people keep their jobs

## Cons:
- Potential anger from employer
- Potential to lose job

## Script:
- "Hey boss, I'm sorry but I don't want to work on this project because it will be causing many people to lose their jobs."
- "Hmm, that's unfortunate..."

## Scripture:
"My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you." -John 15:12

## First Principle:
Watching out for others and helping them keep their source of income is loving them as you would yourself. 

# Response 2: Sabotage the project

## Pros:
- Ensures the project will not cause the layoffs
- Avoids anger from employer if not caught

## Cons:
- Morally incorrect
- Big problems if caught

## Scripture:
"The path of the righteous is level; you, the Upright One, make the way of the righteous smooth." Isaiah 26:7

## First Principle:
Generally, even for a good cause, sabotage will land you in deep trouble, and is against integrity.

# Response 3: Go through with the project.

## Pros:
- No anger from employer
- Help progress in machine learning development
## Cons:
- Cause lots of people to lose their source of income

## Script:
Friend:"I heard some new machine learning development is causing a lot of people to lose their jobs."
Me:"Actually, I was on that project."
Friend:"Wow, I guess you were ok with those people losing their jobs?"
Me:"I was just doing what I was assigned..."

## Scripture:
"Submit yourselves for the Lordâ€™s sake to every human authority: whether to the emperor, as the supreme authority," 1 Peter 2:13

## First Principle:
Though it is unfortunate, it is usually good to follow the authority you are under.

# Conclusion:
Personally, I would choose the third option for this ethical dilemma. Although I find it very unfortunate that the layoffs would happen, this is the progression of machine learning, and there will always be other jobs for those people to fill.
This way I also can avoid bad terms with my boss, and also still continue to submit to authority.
