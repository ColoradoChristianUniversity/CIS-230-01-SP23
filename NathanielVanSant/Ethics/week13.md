# Question

While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, 
you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer

## Option 1: Ask the pastor himself about it

| Pros | Cons |
|------|-----|
| Addresses directly to the pastor himself | May result in confrontation or a problem |
| Does not use a middle man | Could cause more problems than it solves |
| Could get an explaination without causing issues | |

**Script:**
Me: "Hey, I noticed while looking at giving that you were not giving anything to the church. Why is that?"
Pastor: "It's because of a different situation I have here, let me show you."

**Scripture:**

> Ephesians 4:29 - "Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear."

**First principle:**
As Christians, we should always try to start conversations with a goal of reconciling problems.

## Option 2: Tell the Elders and ask them about it

| Pros | Cons |
|------|-----|
| Goes to the church authority | Could cause a problem or miscommunication with the pastor themselves |
| Most likely the elders have an answer for you, or at least would be helpful |   |

**Script:**
Me: "Hey, while looking at the giving, I noticed our paster gives nothing. Is there a reason for that?"
Elders: "Yes, actually I believe there is - but to be sure let's ask him."

**Scripture:**

> Colossians 4:6: "Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person."

**First principle:**

Going to Elders in a church usually is a good option, they are placed in that position on good basis, and will be able to help.

## Option 3: Do Nothing


| Pros | Cons |
|------|-----|
| No conflict | Could leave the pastor never giving |
|  | Assumes the Pastor has some sort of extra situation, which is a con because you have to make an assumption. |

**Script:**

 Doing nothing has no script

**Scripture:**

 > Romans 12:18 - "If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all."

**First principle:**

Sometimes it may be best to assume good intentions with those in Christ with you, though it may be hard.

## Conclusion

Out of these options, I would choose the first option. For me, going to others directly is the best option because it eliminates the need for a middleman or mediator, and 
allows for direct conversation to reach a consensus quicker. It does not involve a mediator like the second option with the Elders, or does not strike me as too passive like the
third option. For me, I would assume that the Pastor had good intentions and start the conversation, so that I can hear exactly what is going on and have that discussion easier.
