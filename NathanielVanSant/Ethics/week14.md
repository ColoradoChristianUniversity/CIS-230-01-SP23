# Question

You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. 
The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until 
put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better 
secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. 
The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals.
However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer

## Option 1: Ensure that the tool cannot be used in foreign governments

| Pros | Cons |
|------|-----|
| Prevents bad actors overseas using the tool to censor certain religions | Lose a customer |
| Keeps the tool "close by" so that you can monitor it's effects | Could create pressure to sell it to those other governments |
| Keeps the tool in the hands of governments that are more trustworthy |  |

**Script:**
Me: "Hey, I am not willing to sell this to foreign governments - it will be too difficult to make sure that it is used neutrally.

**Scripture:**

>  1 Corinthians 4:2 - "Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful." 

**First principle:**
As Christians, when we are given the oppurtunity, we must steward things that we are put in charge of, including keeping it out of the hands of bad actors. 

## Option 2: Do not release the tool

| Pros | Cons |
|------|-----|
| Ensures the tool cannot be used for evil | Ensures the tool cannot be used for good |
| Could make sure that free speech is upkept | Your project that you put a lot of work into goes down the drain |

**Script:**
Me: "Look- I'm really concerned about the reprecussions of releasing this tool. I won't be releasing the tool because I don't think it will be used for good."
Agency Customer: "That is unfortunate. We think this is the wrong choice."

**Scripture:**

> James 4:17: "So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin."

**First principle:**

As Christians, we should try to do the right thing always, even if it costs us - this can mean going against most other people around you.

## Option 3: Release it


| Pros | Cons |
|------|-----|
| Max customers | Could involve the tool being used for evil |
| The project that you worked so hard on is released | Leaves you to assume people will use the tool for good... |

**Script:**

Me: "Alright here is the tool - but do not use it to censor those you don't agree with..."

**Scripture:**

 > Numbers 30:2 - "If a man vows a vow to the Lord, or swears an oath to bind himself by a pledge, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth."
 
**First principle:**

We should try to follow through on what we promise to deliver on.

## Conclusion

Out of these options, I would probably choose the second option. Although it would be difficult to essentially throw away all the work on the tool, I don't believe it would be worth it for the
damage that it could cause. If bad actors had a hold of a tool like this, I think that many censors would appear, and those who go against the bad actor who has the tool
would be censored without them knowing it. I think that rather than trusting that people would use it neutrally or for good, I would not release it at all because of the risk.
