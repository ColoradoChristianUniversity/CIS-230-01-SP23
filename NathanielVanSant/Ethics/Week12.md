# Question

While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your preferred pronouns in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer

## Option 1: Refuse

**Pros:**

 - Stands by what you believe
 - Doesn't give in to whatever HR wants yo to do

**Cons:**

 - HR will be upset with you
 - You may be judged by other coworkers, or even risk your dream job in rare cases

**Script:**

 - Me: "Hey, I wanted to let you know that I won't be doing this due to personal beliefs. I apologize for any inconvinience that I may have caused you."
 - HR: "This is unfortunate. We will not be forgetting about this."

**Scripture:**

> Colossians 3:2 - “Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.”

**First principle:**

As Christians, we need to stick to our guns and beliefs, even if it means risking our dream job.

## Option 2: Question HR

**Pros:**

 - Gets a clearer answer about what they are trying to do
 - Probably gets you in less trouble

**Cons:**

 - Might not answer what you really will do on Thursday
 - May just delay the decision.

**Script:**

- You: "Hey, what exactly are we doing here with this? Any why is it required for everyone?"
- HR: "It's for diversity. We reccomend everybody do it, but I suppose you aren't required."

**Scripture:**

> Matthew 7:7 -  "Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."

**First principle:**

We should try to seek conversation when possible. This way when problems arise we can first attempt conversation instead of confrontation.

## Option 3: Do part of it, putting pronouns but not the pin.

**Pros:**

 - Could decrease the anger of your other coworkers
 - Compromise answer

**Cons:**

 - Doesn't strike me as "sticking to your guns" to comprimise
 - Could still raise some eyebrows when you show up with no pin.

**Script:**

 - You: "Well, got my pronouns in, but I don't think I'll be coming with a pin on Thursday."
 - HR: "hmmmm..."

**Scripture:**

 > Hebrews 10:26 - "For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins"
 
**First principle:**

We may need to compromise sometime in order to keep peace, though we should not completely give in.

## Conclusion

Out of these options, I would pick the first option. Personally, I am the kind of person that thinks you should always stick to your beliefs, no matter what the risks of that are.
For me, the second and third options seem too much like compromise, or not having a spine, and I would want to avoid those compromises in favor of going all the way one
way or another. I think that in reality, some people may take issue with option 1, but that you hopeuflly wouldn't be fired or punished, but if you were, you could
know that it was for beliefs and not for bad work or something else that means something negative in your work life.
