# Question
While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. 
If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1: Notify the project manager, and take on more work for yourself

## Pros:
- Project done on time
- Helps the coworker with less load
- Hopefully the manager will provide help for the coworker

## Cons:
- Stress for yourself
- Potentially causes your manager to look down on your coworker for not performing. This would also mean that your manager is not very understanding

## Script:
Coworker - "Hey man, I'll be frank with you, I've been feeling pretty depressed lately. I'm not even sure how much of this project I'm actually able to do..."
Me - "Oh no, I'm sorry to hear it. I may talk to our PM about it, and we can see about getting your workload lighter. I'll probably take on some of myself... 
I hope you get what you need!"

## Scripture: 
Luke 6:36-37 "Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful. â€œJudge not, and you will not be judged; condemn not, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven;"

## First Principle: As Christians, we should help others who are in need with our own resources and time if we can.


# Response 2: Try to help the coworker best you can, but keep the project as is

## Pros:
- Less stress on yourself
- Saves the coworker from potentially being looked at differently from your manager

## Cons:
- Might not get the help the coworker needs.
- Could result in the project not working out

## Script:
Coworker - "Hey, I've been feeling pretty depressed lately. I'm not sure how much of this project I'll be able to do."
Me - "Im sorry to hear it - I hope you can get some help, let me know if you need anything."

## Scripture:
Proverbs 15:1 "A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger."

## First Principle:
As Christians, we should always offer help to others, and be friendly to them.

# Response 3: Try to give some of the coworker's work to somebody else

## Pros:
- Outsourcing the work relieves the coworker
- Project still goes through

## Cons:
- Spends extra resources on the outsourcing
- Could raise questions from your manager on why the outsourcing is happening

## Script:
Coworker: "Hey, I've been pretty down lately. I'm not sure if I can complete this project."
Me: " Alright, we may be able to find someone else to do the work so that it still goes through."

## Scripture:
"Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God." Hebrews 13:16

## First Principle: as Christians, we should always try to help others, but if we can't help ourselves, we can try to get someone else who can help.


# Conclusion: Personally, I would choose the first option. When someone is struggling, I would want to help them with my own resources,
and make sure that the project can still go through and that they do not feel that they wrecked the project. I also firmly believe that if we have the capacity to help others
do what they cannot, we should. Overall, this option would still prove difficult, because I would need to take on their work as well as my own, but in my eyes it would be worth it
so that they can get the help they need.
