# Question

While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employerâ€™s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1: Refuse to resolve the problems for the customer.


## Pros:
- In refusal, you do not support a pornography company.
- This refusal also hurts the customer, which is a pro.

## Cons:
- If you refuse the task, your employer will be unhappy with you and it could affect your job.
- Your employer will most likely find someone else to do the task, meaning it will still happen regardless.

## Script:
- Me: Hey, I wanted to let you know that I will be declining to help with this resolution, because this is a web site that I fundamentally oppose.
- Employer: Alright, but just be aware that this will affect your performance review...
- Me: I understand, and I am willing to take the concequences. 

## Scripture:
1 Corinthians 6:18 - "Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body."

##First Principle:
It is good to always hold true to your beliefs even when work conflicts against you.

# Response 2: Accept the task and complete it.

## Pros:
- You will remain in good standing with your work
- You will not recieve any penalties and could be a candidate for bonuses or related rewards depending on the size of the customer.

## Cons:
 - You will help support a website that goes against your fundamental beliefs.
 - You assist in something evil remaining and excelling. 

## Script:
- Me: At work this week I am helping with (The website's name).
- Friend: Oh, I've heard of that site, aren't they a pornography site? I'd hate to support that.
- Me: Unfortunatly yes, but I couldn't risk my job and refuse the work...

## Scripture:
Ephesians 4:19: "They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity."

## First Principle:
Sometimes you may need to compromise in order to keep security for those you care about.

# Response 3: Ask your employer if it is possible for other people to do this particular task

## Pros:
- In communicating your problems, your employer may be more understanding and not as harsh in dealing with you.
- You may be able to get out of supporting the website without hurting your work reputation.

## Cons:
- You may still run into conflict if your employer is not understanding.
- You might need to compromise with them if conflict does arise.

## Script:
-Me: Hey, I have some concerns about the next task for me. My beliefs fundamentally differ from those of our customer, and I was hoping somebody else would be able to complete this task in particular.
-Employer: Thank you for bringing this to my attention, we will most likely be able to work something out.
-Me: Thank you for being understanding.

## Scripture:
Ephesians 5:3 - "But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints."

## First Principle
It is always good to look for a way to keep your beliefs intact and not compromise on them, through good communication.

# Conclusion:
I would attempt to go with option 3. The reason I would pick this option is because through communication, I can avoid compromising my beliefs while also keeping a good standing in my occupation and workplace. This option would hopefully result in some sort of workaround, and I would not have to support a website that I fundamentally disagree with. 
I would expect my employer to not be thrilled with my refusal, but would also expect them to be understanding because of my communication with them about the issue.
