# Question
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for
a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1: Explain to company leadership that you did the work

## Pros:
- Get credit for the work that we did
- Clears a misunderstanding

## Cons:
- Could anger the coworker that you were mentoring
- Leadership could think you were lying

## Script:
Me: "Hey, so I wanted to talk about (mentee)'s raise. Most of that work was work that I did, but it seems there's been a misunderstanding."
Leadership: "Ah, ok. Let's all talk together to work this out."

## Scripture: "Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them." Ephesians 5:11

## First Principle: We should always speak up for what is right, and fix miscommunications. 

# Response 2: Talk with the mentee

## Pros:
- Establishes conversation from the get-go
- Hopefully brings a solution to leadership so that both parties are already on the same page

## Cons:
- The mentee could think you're accusing them of something

## Script:
Me: "Hey, I know you have that raise coming up, but most of that project was my work - we should talk to leadership about it"
Mentee: "Yeah, Seems they made a mistake, let's get it sorted"

## Scripture: Proverbs 18:13 "To answer before listeningâ€” that is folly and shame."

## First Principle: As Christians, we should be always willing to talk things out in a respectful manner when miscommunications occur.


# Response 3: Tell management that the work was done by both of you

## Pros:
- Still gives the mentee some credit, assuming they helped at least a little bit!
- Allows both of you to bring a joint message to leadership instead of a one-sided argument

## Cons:
- Probably still gives the mentee too much credit, and you probably lose out on money

## Script:
Me: "Hey, would you be willing to both go to leadership so that we are both recognized for the work here?"
Mentee: "Sure, you did do a lot after all."

## Scripture: Proverbs 31:9: "Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy."


## First Principle: As Christians, we should not be afraid to speak up for ourselve,s if it is righteous.


# Conclusion: Overall, I think I would choose the second option. Talking with the mentee first gives room to come up with a solution to give to leadership, and also 
	allows for a discussion right off the bat instead of leaving room for the mentee to be angry at you. It also allows the discussion to not be pressured by leadership
	imposing their own solution on you, since you could probably take more time to discuss it if you go to the mentee first.
