# Prompt: 
While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: Ignore the situation entirely.

| **游릴 Pros:**     | **游린 Cons:**        |
| ----------| ----------  |
| Avoid any confrontation with the senior pastor.    | It may feel uncomfortable to continue knowing that the senior pastor is not contributing financially to the church.       |
| Continue volunteering without any tension or awkwardness.    | It might create tension or hypocrisy, especially if the senior pastor is preaching about giving to the church.      |


**游꿠 Script:**
Me: Hi, Pastor. I was going through some giving records for the church and noticed that you haven't made any contributions. Is there any particular reason for that?

Pastor: Oh, I just prefer to give in other ways, like volunteering my time.

Me: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you for explaining.


**游닀 Scripture:**
"Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." - Matthew 7:1-2

## Option 2: Address the situation directly with the senior pastor.

| **游릴 Pros:**     | **游린 Cons:**       |
| ----------| ----------  |
| This approach allows for open communication and a chance for the senior pastor to explain their reasoning or oversight.    | The senior pastor may feel uncomfortable or defensive.      |
| It may also prompt the senior pastor to start giving to the church.     | It may harm the relationship between the senior pastor and I.      |
| It can help to avoid any awkwardness or tension caused by the discovery.     | It may result in no change in the senior pastor's giving behavior.       |


**游꿠 Script:**
Me: Hi, Pastor. I noticed that you haven't made any contributions to the church. I'm a bit confused since you often preach about the importance of giving. Could you help me understand why you're not giving?

Pastor: Well, to be honest, my financial situation has been a bit tight lately. I've had some unexpected expenses and haven't been able to contribute financially.

Me: I see. Is there anything we as a church can do to support you during this time?


**游닀 Scripture:**
"Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift." - Matthew 5:23-24

## Option 3:  Report the situation to the church leadership.

| **游릴 Pros:**     | **游린 Cons:**       |
| ----------| ----------  |
| It can ensure that the senior pastor is held accountable and fulfills their responsibility to give financially to the church.    | It may result in a loss of trust or negative consequences for the senior pastor.      |
| It can provide transparency and maintain integrity within the church.    | It may create tension or conflict within the church leadership.       |
|      | It could lead to the volunteer being seen as disloyal or intrusive.       |



**游꿠 Script:**
Me: Hi, Church Leadership. I was looking at the giving records for the church and noticed that the Senior Pastor hasn't made any contributions. I'm not sure if this is an oversight or if there's a reason for it, but I thought it might be something you'd want to know.

Church Leadership: Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We'll look into it and see if there's anything we need to do to ensure that everyone is fulfilling their responsibilities to support the church financially.


**游닀 Scripture:**
"But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.'" - Matthew 18:16

## Conclusion
There is no one "right" way to respond to this situation, and each option has its pros and cons. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide which approach aligns best with their values and the culture of their church. It may be helpful to seek advice from other trusted church leaders or to pray for guidance before making a decision.

## My Choice
Each of these options has potential benefits and drawbacks. Ignoring the situation may be the easiest option, but it could also lead to lingering doubts or a guilty conscious. Addressing the situation directly with the pastor may help clear up any misunderstandings and promote transparency, but it could also be uncomfortable or potentially damaging to the relationship. Reporting the information to church leadership may help ensure that everyone is fulfilling their responsibilities, but it could also create tension or conflict within the church community.

Ultimately, the decision of how to proceed should be based on your personal values and the specific circumstances of the situation. It may be helpful to consider factors such as the culture and practices of your church, your relationship with the pastor, and your goals for the outcome of the situation. Additionally, it may be helpful to seek guidance and advice from other trusted individuals, such as other church leaders or mentors.
