# Week 10
While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## **Option 1:** Admit your mistake and tell your boss

### **Pros** ðŸŸ¢:
- Own up to your mistakes
- Get credit for taking ownership
- Might be able to fix the code

### **Cons** ðŸ›‘
- You lose the Sunday sabbath
- Not only this week but could be a more frequent occurence
- Remove boundaries you have set

### **Script**
- Collin: (Set as an Email) So I goofed and broke the code late saturday night. I worked through the night and got the bug ironed out sometime sunday afternoon sow we should be good to resume work Monday morning.

### **Scripture**
> Proverbs 28:13  "Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy."

### **Principle**
- Taking ownership can be scary but in the long term it can lead to more grace as leadership know that you are willing to do what it takes and are willing to won up to the mistakes you made.

## **Option 2:** Uphold your Sabbath

### **Pros** ðŸŸ¢
- keep your boundaries
- Upholding God's command

### **Cons** ðŸ›‘
- Hurts the company
- You loose the condifence of leadership and co-workers

### **Script**
- Collin: So i messed up this code on saturday night and because my sabbath is Sunday I will not be working on it until work resumes on Monday.

### **Scripture**
> Exodus 20:8 "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy"

### **Principle**
- Keeping the sabbath and a day that is Holy to God is important because those days are the ones the He provides for us causing us to trust in Him more.


## **Option 3:** Take a step back to evaluate why you are working on a Saturday 

### **Pros** ðŸŸ¢
- Create better boundaries

### **Cons** ðŸ›‘
- Might not have a job anymore
- Could lose face in the HR world

### **Script**
- Collin: Hey God, I need your advice and wisdom in my current job situation ...

### **Scripture**
> Proverbs 2:6 " For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;"
> James 1:5 " If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him."

### **Principle**
- Even with the ability to work from home, there are boundaries that we need to set. We are not desinged to work 24/7. 
## Conclusion
With work now being more of a hybrid it can be difficult to draw the line on when to stop working and uphold days of rest.

## My Choice
My choice would be to do the work on Saturday and Sunday so the business will not be delayed due to my mistake. While doing this I would be heavily evaluating my current work enviroment and culture> I have no problem working but I am not designed to work 6 days a week constantly. When this came up I would be considering the culture of the work enviroment I am in.
