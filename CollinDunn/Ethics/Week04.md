## Conclusion
This situation is tricky because all the options are valid in different ways. 

## My Choice
I would follow the course of option 1. The business can deal with the project a mans life and emotion is becoming cloudy and disallusioned and the business can find a new customrer it cant ever replace that exact coworker.
