# Week 3
While maintaining a very popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking thatyou introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

Response

## **Option 1:** Build in the back door

### **Pros**
- You help the government bust a child trafficking scheme
- Children are saffer
- Criminals are behind bars

### **Cons**
- You violate the trust of the code users (to their knowledge or not)
- You have to work with the government
- You dont know where else the government is installing back doors

### **Script**
- GVT: Collin, we woul dlike you to add in a back door to your project to help catch some child traffickers 
- Collin: Ok, lets figure out how we can do this


### **Scripture**
Psalms 82:3-4 " Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.” 

### **Principle**
- God calls us to protect those who cant and that includes children. Especially children as Jesus says theirs is the kingdom of Heaven

## **Option 2:** Go to the meeting and ask questions

### **Pros**
- Understand the project and the scope of what is wanted
- Greater understanding
- Build relationships

### **Cons**
- The project has a later start date
- People in the GVT might get annoyed when it does not start on time


### **Script**
- GVT: Hey Collin we want you to build a back door into your project
- Collin: This isnt a great place to talk. Lets set up a time to talk about what will be required

### **Scripture**
> Proverbs 16:3 "Commit to the LORD whatever you do, and he will establish your plans."


### **Principle**
- God is working through us and He will bless our work. But we are also called to be dilligent and steward the earth so before you commit to the work it is smart to understand what would be required for the project

## **Option 3:** Pray on the matter

### **Pros**
- You bring God into your work
- Asking for wisdom


### **Cons**
- There will be a delay in the project
- The GVT might find someone else to work with


### **Script**
- GVT: Collin we would like you to put this back door into your project
- Collin: Thank you, but I will need a some time to consider my options and get a response to you

### **Scripture**
> James 1:5 " If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. "


### **Principle**
- God gives wisdom to those who ask. We see this with king Solomon asking God for wisdom over earthly riches

## Conclusion
Life presents us with difficult descions where we can help the greater good but at a cost that might ruin our reputation in our personal lives. This situation shows that perfectly where if we help the GVT we can save countless children from a terrible life, but at the cost of your Open-source project loosing credibilty as being a safe place to put code. 

## My Choice
I would follow Option 3. THis is a big descion to make that has lots of impact not only on yourself but also on those around you. I would like to fall to prayer and seek God and His widom before giving the government an answer to their question.
