# Week 16
You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's technically true, but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you specifically because you have access to details of the public figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking about, as they often attack Christians in public without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency and individual dignity. You also consider your belief in obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, and the right of self-preservation. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## **Option 1:** Obvious Option: Tell the media what they want

| Pros 🟢 🚥| Cons 🛑 🚥|
| ---- | ---- |
|Pro 1: Help your own career | Con 1: Not honoring to God |
|Pro 2: Spite an unlikable person | Con 2: This could really backfire |


### **Script**
- Media: Collin tell us about ... and their activites ... 
- Collin: Here you go (discloses private information)

### **Scripture**
> Daniel 2:21 "He changes times and seasons; he removes kings and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding; "
> 1 John 2:4 "  Whoever says “I know him” but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him, "

### **Principle**
- Tell the truth because God will apoint the leaders of Earth.

## **Option 2:** Sidestep the questions and Honor your commitments

| Pros 🟢 🚥| Cons 🛑 🚥|
| ---- | ---- |
|Pro 1: Honor God | Con 1: Could impact their career and yours |
|Pro 2: respecting the privacy of others | Con 2: Someone else can still share the information |

### **Script**
- Media: Collin tell us about ... and their activites ... 
- Collin: No that is not my place to talk about. ... (Avoid it or make no comment)


### **Scripture**
> Ephesians 4:29 "Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear."

### **Principle**
- Speaking what is honoring to the Lord and to others is something we are called to do escpecailly with people God has put into power.

## **Option 3:** Seek counsel

| Pros 🟢 🚥| Cons 🛑 🚥|
| ---- | ---- |
|Pro 1: Understand the situation better  | Con 1: Miss an oppurtunity for good or bad |
| Pro 2 : Get outside perspective |  |

### **Script**
- Collin: Hey, mentor can I talk to you about ... and the situation I am in

### **Scripture**
> Proverbs 15:22 " Without counsel plans fail, but with many advisers they succeed."
> James 1:5 "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him."

### **Principle**
- Seeking counsel from people who are wiser than you is never a bad thing. God even tells us to ask Him for wisdom in tough scenarios.

## Conclusion
Finding the line between what you may want to do and what God says is right can be a hard thing to accept.

## My Choice
I choose option 2. Seeking guidance and counsel from God and from others seems like the best course of action to honor all parties involved. While a lot of us may want to spill the details right when asked, it is wise to seek counsel from those who have wisdom to give.
