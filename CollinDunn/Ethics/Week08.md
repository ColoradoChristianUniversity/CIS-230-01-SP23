# Week 8
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## **Option 1:** Talk to Leadership (Boss)

### **Pros** 🟢:
- Bring more light to the situation
- Proper escalation

### **Cons** 🛑
- IT might look like you are tatteling

### **Script**
- Collin: Hey boss, I just wanted to bring you more into this situation with the new kid and the work that was done on the project.

### **Scripture**
> Ephesians 4:25 "Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body."

### **Principle**
-Being honest an daccountable makes you a good employee you are looking out for the company. 

## **Option 2:** Do nothing and let him expose himself

### **Pros** 🟢
- You dont look like a snitch
- Non-confrontational
- It solves itself

### **Cons** 🛑
- It can take a while
- Your name can be tied to the project and it might get hurt as well

### **Script**
- Boss: Hey Billy Joe, can you demenstate and explain XYZ to the board
- Billy Joe: UHH sure (Makes a fool of himself)

### **Scripture**
> Romans 12:19 "Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,” says the Lord."

### **Principle**
- God will repay what people will deserve and it is His to control


## **Option 3:** Talk to your Coworker

### **Pros** 🟢
- Get to the root of the problem
- adress the problem head one

### **Cons** 🛑
- Very confrontational
- Could get uggly

### **Script**
- Collin: Billy Joe, can we talk about the credit you are getting on this project that we have ALL worked on

### **Scripture**
> Matthew 18:15 "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."

### **Principle**
- Coming to someone in a loving sense can help to smooth things out before they get out of control. 

## Conclusion
Relationships are hard to manage and there are many ways to approach confrontation with out it getting super ugly.

## My Choice
I would choose option 3, becaue it is the first logical step to do. You can come to him as a co-worker before making a descion on what to do next. If he owns up to the truth thats it. But if he doesnt you can properly escalate it properly and keep moving from there.
