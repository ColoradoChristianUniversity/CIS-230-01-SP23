# Week 13
While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## **Option 1:** Ignore it for now and try to collect more information

| Pros ðŸŸ¢ ðŸš¥| Cons ðŸ›‘ ðŸš¥|
| ---- | ---- |
|Pro 1: Keep your head out of Private Business | Con 1: Awkward gulity feeling |
|Pro 2: It seems like you werent snooping | Con 2: someting could be going on and you are ignorring it |


### **Script**
- Collin: ... That is strange. I wonder what is going. (Pray and ask for guidance)

### **Scripture**
> 1 Thessalonians 4:11 "And to aspire to live quietly, and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we instructed you, "

### **Principle**
- Mind our own business because when we start judging others we overlook the sins and mistakes we make. 

## **Option 2:** Approach your Pastor

| Pros ðŸŸ¢ ðŸš¥| Cons ðŸ›‘ ðŸš¥|
| ---- | ---- |
|Pro 1: To the point | Con 1: Awkward conversation |
|Pro 2: Get an answer | Con 2: It seems like you were snooping |
|  | Con 3: He could lie to you |

### **Script**
- Collin: Hey, Pastor i noticed something when I was in the computer system that I was wonderting if you could shed some light on

### **Scripture**
> Proverbs 27:17 "Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another. "

### **Principle**
- Being held accountable is not always fun and hoding people accountable is not a walk in the park either but it helps everyone around to be better and to further reach out be the people of God.


## **Option 3:** Bring it up to an elder

| Pros ðŸŸ¢ ðŸš¥| Cons ðŸ›‘ ðŸš¥|
| ---- | ---- |
|Pro 1: Accountabilty  | Con 1: Not your place |
|Pro 2: Another party is involved | Con 2: Can seem like tatteling |
|Pro 3: Its not your word vs his word | |

### **Script**
- Collin: Hey elder, I noticed this when I was in the sytem and I thought it was something you should be aware of.

### **Scripture**
> 1 Thessalonians 5:11  "Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing. "

### **Principle**
- You get to build up your pastor hopefully and it does not seem like you are out to get him.

## Conclusion
Finding something like this is a hard situation because its information that is private. There are many options of how to approach it and each are right and wrong in their own rights. 

## My Choice
I think I would go with option 3. It brings another concerned party into the mix to proctect both you and the pastor so it is not just one persons word agaisnst another who is in the situation. It is a very hard thing to deal with becaue the information is so private.
