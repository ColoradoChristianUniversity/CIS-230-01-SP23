## Conclusion
In the workforce sometimes you have to make the descion on what is best for the company, friends, and yourself. It is alot of factors to consider because there are many moving variables in what will influence your descion.

## My Choice
I would choose option 1. I think this would be a good way to still maintain connections in the work community and still do the work that is required of you. If you get fired then hopefully one of the co-workers that you stuck your neck out to proctect will help you. I think that this is a dicey situation because your goal is to make the company your work for more efficient. But there are ways to look out for those around you and still get the work done.
