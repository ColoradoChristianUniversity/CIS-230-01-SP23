# Week 14
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## **Option 1:** Work Hard to Finish the product

| Pros ðŸŸ¢ ðŸš¥| Cons ðŸ›‘ ðŸš¥|
| ---- | ---- |
|Pro 1: Completing good work | Con 1: The product can be misused|

### **Scripture**
> Proverbs 14:23 " In all toil there is profit, but mere talk tends only to poverty."

### **Principle**

## **Option 2:** Raise some questions

| Pros ðŸŸ¢ ðŸš¥| Cons ðŸ›‘ ðŸš¥|
| ---- | ---- |
|Pro 1: Better Understand the work and liscenensing | Con 1: Slows doewn the work flow |
|Pro 2: Get an answer | Con 2: Could be seen as lazy |

### **Script**
- Collin: Hey, Manager I had a couple questions about the product being licensced out. Can We (the develpment team) get some more information about that?

### **Scripture**
> Matthew 7:7 "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. "

### **Principle**
- Knwoing the right question to ask to the right person is crucial to thriving in the work place and doing good work for the Lord


## **Option 3:** Drag your feet on the work

| ---- | ---- |
|Pro 1: Slows down the product to get answers  | Con 1: Not honring God or the company |
| | Con 2:Product could be completed by someone else |

### **Script**
- Collin: We want answers and are not going to work until we get them

### **Scripture**
> Romans 13:1  " Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God."

### **Principle**
- Honoring the authorities is important unless they go against what the Lord has put in place

## Conclusion
The balance between honoring the government and honoring what God has put in place is a tricky balance to manage.

## My Choice
I think I would go with option 2. Finding out more information is never a bad thing when it comes to making a hard decision. Gathering information to make a decison that is honoring to God and the Company and the World is always benefical to everyone.
