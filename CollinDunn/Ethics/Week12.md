# Week 12
While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your preferred pronouns in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## **Option 1:** Call out sick on Thursday

### **Pros** ðŸŸ¢:
- Avoid the problem
- No confrontation

### **Cons** ðŸ›‘
- You use a sick day
- Could backfire

### **Script**
- Collin: (Set as an Email) Hey boss, I caught a nasty case of food poisining last night and I wont be able to make it into work tomorrow (Thursday).

### **Scripture**
> Psalm 1:1 "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers;"

### **Principle**
- Understnding what could be a bad situation for you can help to avoid unwanted confrontation and can help to continue the glory of God.

## **Option 2:** Go with what they ask to be a witness for God

### **Pros** ðŸŸ¢
- Can be a witness
- Go with what the company wants

### **Cons** ðŸ›‘
- Can be awkward

### **Script**
- Collin: Ok, sounds good!

### **Scripture**
> Matthew 5:16 "In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven."

### **Principle**
- God tells us that we need be a light on the Hill not under a bowl. This is a great oppurtunity to be a witness to people in the company.


## **Option 3:** Do one but not the other.

### **Pros** ðŸŸ¢
- Kinda comply
- Try to appease the company
- Hold to some of your boundries

### **Cons** ðŸ›‘
- Could backfire


### **Script**
- Collin: I did the pronouns, but I do not feel comfortable wearing a Pin today becasue of my relegion.

### **Scripture**
> 1 Corinthians 10:31 "So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."

### **Principle**
- Our actions glorify God and we want to be like Him yet still uphold our own boundaries. 

## Conclusion
Where is the line between upholding company requests and holding true to personal boundaries. It is a hard line to draw because we feel like we have to comply with everything the company asks no matter what we feel.

## My Choice
I think I would go with option 3. I would have a good talk with my immediate manager, to tell them that I am uncomfortable with wearing a pin on that day. I would comply with the pronouns but have an honest conversation with the manager to let them know how you feel and what the best way to proceed is.
