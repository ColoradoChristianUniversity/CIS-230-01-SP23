You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it very clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:

 >Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own. The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation. For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words, students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.

Then this

Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is, so to speak, on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?

Response

## **Option 1:** Surrender it

### **Pros** 🟢:
- No confrontation
- The class go smoothly
- no reports filed

### **Cons** 🛑
- The student does not learn several valuable lessons

### **Script**
- Collin: ... OK God, how should I respond to this 🙏


### **Scripture**
>Luke 6:31 " Do to others as you would have them do to you.

### **Principle**
- If we were in this sitation, we dont fully know what the other person is going through and why they made that choice. So by praying and surrendering it to God, He may reveal to us what the best option is. 

## **Option 2:** Go to the student and ask questions

### **Pros** 🟢
- Build a relationship
- Understand them
- Hopefully reduce the consequences

### **Cons** 🛑
- The student might not want to talk
- Can be seen as not a good thing


### **Script**
- Collin: Hey Billy Joe, do you have some thime to talk about your most recent coding assignmnet?
- Billy Joe: Uhhh, sure
- Collin: I noticed that its identical to the C# youtube video and I just wanted to know what was going on?
- Billy Joe: Oh Yeah sorry about that ....

### **Scripture**
> Philipians 2:4-5 “Don’t look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too. You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had.”

### **Principle**
- As Christians we need to seek to udnerstand those around us. In their actions and beliefs to that we can best love them and share the Gospel with them.

## **Option 3:** Do what you contract says

### **Pros** 🟢
- You show tough love by correcting them
- The impact it could have could set them on the right path for years to come

### **Cons** 🛑
- It is an ugly sitation
- Reports and conversations with the Dean

### **Script**
- Collin: Billy Joe, I hate to do this but I am filing a report for plagerism

### **Scripture**
> Colosians 3:14 "And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony."

### **Principle**
- Love is a tough thing. Its not always about compasion and enabling. Sometimes love is calling someone out and upholding the dutuis you have to best love someone. 

## Conclusion
Love is difficult to do becasue it can present itself in so many ways. 

## My Choice
This is a difficult choice to make. I was in a very similar situation this last week where a commitment that I agreed to was holding me to a higher standard of love. I made the hard choice then and I am sure that it was the right choice in that situation but I am not sure it is the right choice here. I would act on sitation 2 to better understand the student to know where they are coming from and then put them on notice for the rest of the year.
