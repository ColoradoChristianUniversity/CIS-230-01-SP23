# Scenario

While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employer’s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

## **Option 1:** Doing the work

### **Pros**
- You don’t raise a fuss in the workplace by keeping your head down
- You do a good job and get a raise
- Shows that you are a good worker willing to do what is needed

### **Cons**
- You are indirectly supporting the pornography industry and human trafficking
- More people get pulled into the industry as actors and as consumers

### **Script**
- Boss: Hey Collin do you mind working on this problem we are having with this customer
- Collin: Sure thing I will look over it and keep you updated on what’s going on
- Boss: Remember they are our second largest customer they want it down well

### **Scripture**
> Romans 13:1 " Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God."

### **Principle**
- God put people in charge for a reason and we are to obey them as they are a put there for a reason 


## **Option 2:** Respectfully bring it up

### **Pros**
- In a respectful sense you admit that you are not comfortable working on this project
- You stand up for your morals

### **Cons**
- Your boss thinks that you are lazy and will not assign work to you
- Coworkers get frustrated because they have to pick up your share of the work
- You could get fired

### **Script**
- Boss: Hey Collin do you mind working on this problem we are having with this customer
- Collin: Actually I wanted to talk about that> I do not feel comfortable working on this project due to personal reasons
- Boss: Do you mind if we talked about why
- Collin: Yes lets set up a meeting to discuss this in depth

### **Scripture**
> Romans 14:13-23 "13 Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother. 14 I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean. 15 For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died. 16 So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil. 17 For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. 18 Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men. 19 So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding. 20 Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats. 21 It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble.[a] 22 The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves. 23 But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin."

### **Principle**
- We are called to be witness and that starts with our actions and sometimes that calls for helping those around you not to stumble


## **Option 3:** You quit

### **Pros**
- People know where you stand morally
- You helping this company is not on your conscience

### **Cons**
- You loose a job
- You could possibly get blackballed in the hiring community

### **Script**
- Boss: Collin we need you to do this project even though we have had conversations about how you feel about it 
- Collin: No, I quit. I don’t wont to work in a company that supports this and forces me to do something we have talked about

### **Scripture**
> 1 Corinthians 16:13 "Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong."

### **Principle**
- As Christians our work glorifies God and it is important to honor him in all that we do this includes how we respond to leaders. While they are put there by God we need to stand up and follow righteous leaders who follow God

## Conclusion
In life we might work for a company that has customers that have morals that we might not agree with. Life is all about how we respond to the choices that are presented around us. And our choices are impacted by the factors that are all around us that are happening at home. 

## My Choice
I would probably choose option 3 because I have seen the damage that the pornography industry has on this world. I would have an incredibly hard time being on a team or apart of a company that is knowingly supporting that industry because of the damage it has. I think this is the best option for me because the weight of that work would weigh on my conscience long after I go home for work each day and for years after that work is completed.
