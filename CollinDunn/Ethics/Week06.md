# Week 6 Ethics

## Response to Week 03

### Daniel Wolf
- Refusal to do the work
- Interesting dialoge
- It seems like a very high level look into the scenario
- The application and versus are good
- The end where he brings in a real world scenario is really interesting and well thought out. 
> For Daniel's option I think I best agree with Option 3: where you help to gather evidence on the scheme. I think this is a viable option in the options that he presents.

### Madeline Bourgelt
- Thought out options/choices
- in-depth principles and scriptual references
- Acknolodgement of the consequences of her actions on others
- The final response and conclusion shows that lots of throught was put into her making the descion
> I really like Madelin's option 2, wher you comply with the government and then make a statement is possible after the operation is over. If I was picking off of her scenario options I would follow her option 2. 

## Conclusion
On this topic I agree with both of the authors. I think this is a really intersting situation becasue it is a hard topic to think about and do you help children or protect your own name and project that you have worked on. It would be interesting to do this type of respnse again in a few weeks to see responses on ome of the upcoming weeks. I would be really interested to see what people are going to say on Week05 becasue I thought that it was a really gray situation that had several right approaches.
