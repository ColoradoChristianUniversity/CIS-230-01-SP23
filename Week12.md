## Conclusion

What a tricky situation this is. The company that you may work for may have zero tolerance. In a enigma like this it really comes down to what kind of company you work for. 
I personally would most likely go to God with something like this. When a decison seems impossible it is always good to get God in the mix. Also, talking to the manager would be great because hopefully a great gospel conversation could come from it.
Overall, this situation is a very complicated one that would require some serious attention if I was trying to keep my job at my dream company. 

## My Choice

Out of the options above, I would choose Option 3: Pray about it. Praying about it can never be a wrong answer. Bringing God directly into a decision is always smart considering we should always trust Him with our lives. This is a difficult issue but hopefully counsel with God and others would allow for a decision that would be pleasing to the company.
