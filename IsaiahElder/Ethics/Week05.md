# Scenario
**Situation setup**

You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it very clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:

> Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own.
> The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation.
> For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words, students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.

**Then this**

Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is, so to speak, on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?

# Option 1: Report the student and Follow The Administration
**Pros:**
- This is the most fair option
- can use this as a teaching moment for clarification for the rules on plagarising code

**Cons:**
- The student may recieve a fail on the course\
- this may discourage other students from working together to solve problems in their code

**Script**
- me: "Hey Dr. Kerr, I've got some pretty good evidence that one of my students may have plagarized some code online."
- Kerr: "I'll get in contact and set up a meeting, thanks for bringing this to my attention."

> Romans 13:1 ESV - Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.

**First Principle:**
There are explicit rules against plagarism, and this student broke them.

# Option 2: Talk with the student
**Pros:**
- The student may not have thought that using a tutorial was cheating, considered it a tool
- clarifying for the student could put a stop to the cheating, without failing them

**Cons:**
- The student may continue their behavior
- It could be unfair to the students that did the work on their own and didn't use a tutorial 

**Script**
- me: "Hey student, I saw your last assignment followed a tutorial exactly, that could be considered cheating."
- student: "Oh shoot, I didn't think that following a tutorial would be cheating."
- me: "I'm going to have to give you a zero for the assignment, email me with questions in the future if you get stuck on an assignment."
> 1 Thessalonians 5:11 ESV - Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.

**First Principle:**
Talking and guiding this student is the most important, and they shouldn't be punished for an honest mistake

# Option 3: Ask your dean for advice 
**Pros:**
- The dean determines what you should do, so you dont have to make the hard decision
- This keeps the decision impartial and fair
**Cons:**
- A person not familiar with how code is written would be making the decision
- The student could be heavily punished

**Script**
- me: "Hey Dr. Kerr, I've got some pretty good evidence that one of my students may have plagarized some code online, I don't think they did it maliciously but it is fairly obvious that they used someone else's code."
- Kerr: "Meet with the student, talk with them to see why they did this, then go from there."

> Proverbs 11:14 ESV - Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.

**First Principle:**
In odd situations like this one, it is best to look to the authority on making this decision

# Conclusion
While deciding which option to choose, I kept coming back to what the motivation is for a student following a tutorial about the code, and how/if it is any different from using sources like stack exchange to help iron out quirks in your code. I would end up meeting with the student, both to discern their intentions and let them know that copying as blatant as this could be considered plagarism. If it was an honest mistake, and the copying ceased than the problem is solved, but if the student continues to cheat I can still take action.
