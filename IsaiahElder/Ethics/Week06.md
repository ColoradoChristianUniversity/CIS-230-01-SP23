# Scenario
**This week is different**

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The [root of this site](https://github.com/ColoradoChristianUniversity/CIS-230-01-SP23) has the ethics write-up of everyone in class. You can go there and you can browse and read anyone's essays. Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. In this week's essay, summarize each with a simple bullet list and pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). Given their choices, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not. Do you want to include a third essay? That's up to you.
