# Scenario
**This week is different**

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The [root of this site](https://github.com/ColoradoChristianUniversity/CIS-230-01-SP23) has the ethics write-up of everyone in class. You can go there and you can browse and read anyone's essays. Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. In this week's essay, summarize each with a simple bullet list and pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). Given their choices, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not. Do you want to include a third essay? That's up to you.

Week 4 is the prompt that resonates with me the most. 

# Nathaniel

- Focused mostly on the project workload
  - Take some of your co-workers work onto yourself
  - outsource their work 
  - leave the project as is
- Took a proactive approach in every option
- Decided to relieve the co-worker of some duties by taking them onto himself


# Dora 

- Focuses on communication
  - Talking and praying with the teammate
  - Advising the teammate to take a break from the project
  - Telling a higher-up about the problem
- Allowed the teammate to make the decision for themselves, while advising them to take a step back
- Decided on the second option

# Conclusion 

I agree the most with Dora's decision. When it comes to mental health, you can only push yourself so far and the coworker's well being is worth more to me than the possibility of having to pick up their slack.
