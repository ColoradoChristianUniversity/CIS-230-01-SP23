# Scenario
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Option 1: Let anyone liscense the product
| **Pros**       | **Cons**       | 
| ---------------| ---------------| 
| The product will be very successful | It will be used to remove all religion from public places | 
| The Product will be widely used, and this a good reference | I could be used by less free countries to attack christianity |

**Script**
- Customer: "Hello, we would like to use your product."
- Me: "Sure thing, take a look at our rates."

> Proverbs 16:3 - Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established.

**First Principle:**
Success is the best refernece for future work opportunitites.


# Option 2: Let no one use the program for this

| **Pros**       | **Cons**       | 
| ---------------| ---------------| 
| The program wouldn't be used for removing religionfrom the public | The program could be considered a failure | 
| The program wouldn't be used for religous persecution |  |


**Script**
- Customer: "Hello, we would like to use your product."
- Me: "I'm sorry, we don't liscense our product to public facilities"

> Matthew 16:26 - For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?

**First Principle:**
Preventing the washing of religous influence is very important

# Option 3: carefully consider and limit who is able to use it

| **Pros**       | **Cons**       | 
| ---------------| ---------------| 
|  Prevents the use of the software for religous persecution | Limits the widespread use of the product | 
| Would still allow growth of the company |  |


**Script**
- Customer: "Hello, we would like to use your product."
- Me: "Sure thing, Let me walk you through our acceptable use policy"

> Proverbs 4:5 - Get wisdom; get insight; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.

**First Principle:**
Carefully choosing customers would allow the company to grow 

# Conclusion
The crux of this problem is how much I am willing to sacrifice the presence of Christianity in public facilities and the world. There is also the consideration of freedom of speech and equal treatment of religion in the US. Finally I thought about the implications of foreign countries persecuting christians through the use of this program. I ultimately decided with option 3, considering the use of the program and implementing a check for an active key and proper use of the software. This way I would be able to make sure that the equal representation of religion in the united states stays intact while preventing the prosecution of any people group using this software.
