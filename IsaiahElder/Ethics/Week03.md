# Scenario
While maintaining a very popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
# Option 1: Introduce the code
**Pros:**
- Complying with authorities
- Helping put a stop to the child trafficking 

**Cons:**
- the backdoor code could be used by authorities for less serious situations, i.e. spying on users or contributers
- the backdoor could introduce security risks and make the software more vulnerable

**Script**
- Authorities: Hey Isaiah, we think that some people are using this software to assist in their child trafficking set up. Can you install a backdoor so we can view user data?
- Me: Absolutely, I'll send you the credentials when its fully installed.
> Titus 3:1 ESV - Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work
**First Principle:**
In curcumstances when my actions could help put an end to suffering, I should comply.

# Option 2: Refuse to put in the backdoor
**Pros:**
- Keeps the security of the software intact
- Keeps user privacy as a top priority

**Cons:**
- The authorities may force my hand/ have jurisdiction
- may create tension with coworkers that see no probelm with the project

**Script**
- Authorities: Hey Isaiah, we think that some people are using this software to assist in their child trafficking set up. Can you install a backdoor so we can view user data?
- Me: I can't compromise my users' privacy and security like that 

> Numbers 30:2 ESV - If a man vows a vow to the Lord, or swears an oath to bind himself by a pledge, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.
**First Principle:**
Keeping my word to the customers is important

# Option 3: Work with the authorities to find these users without installing a backdoor
**Pros:**
- Does not compromise security of the software
- Helps stop the child trafficing 

**Cons:**
- Authorities will need to contact me directly to access the userbase, potentially wasting time
- it may take longer for the smaller team to find these people without the help of the authorities' team

**Script**
- Authorities: Hey Isaiah, we think that some people are using this software to assist in their child trafficking set up. Can you install a backdoor so we can view user data?
- Me: I can't compromise the whole userbase like that, but lets work together to find these people

> Ezekiel 45:9 ESV - Thus says the Lord God: Enough, O princes of Israel! Put away violence and oppression, and execute justice and righteousness. Cease your evictions of my people, declares the Lord God.
**First Principle:**
Being good steward for the user base and working with authorities are both important.

# Conclusion
In this situation, there are two factors that I have considered: the privacy of the userbase and the imnportance of justice. If I were to compromise the privacy of the consumers, the software would be worse off and I could possibly introduce security issues that weren't there previously. If I refuse to act, then I am allowing for this evil to continue. I would choose the third option I provided, because it doesn't compromise the software, yet still puts a stop to the criminal activity.
