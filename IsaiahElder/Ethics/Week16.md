# Scenario
You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's technically true, but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you specifically because you have access to details of the public figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking about, as they often attack Christians in public without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency, and individual dignity. You also consider your belief in obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, and the right of self-preservation. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Option 1: Corroborate their claims
| **Pros**       | **Cons**       | 
| ---------------| ---------------| 
| Take away the platform of someone I don't like | The promotion isn't earned | 
| I could get a promotion | |

**Script**
- News crew: "Do you have anything to comment?"
- Me: "Yes! He actually did do those things!."

>Luke 12:2 - There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known.

**First Principle:**
Taking someone who persecutes Christians off of their pedestal would be good all around. 


# Option 2: No comment

| **Pros**       | **Cons**       | 
| ---------------| ---------------| 
| I don't attack someone in public | I miss out on the opportunity for a promotion | 
|  | They retain their platform |


**Script**
- News crew: "Do you have anything to comment?"
- Me: "No comment."

> 1 John 4:20 -  Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.

**First Principle:**
Attacking someone in public is wrong

# Option 3: point out what they are doing

| **Pros**       | **Cons**       | 
| ---------------| ---------------| 
| Points out the hypocrisy of the news crew | I miss out on the opportunity for a promotion| 
|  | They retain their platform |


**Script**
- News crew: "Do you have anything to comment?"
- Me: "Don't you think attacking someone personally like this is a little extreme?"

>Matthew 6:1 - â€œBe careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.

**First Principle:**
Pointing out hypocrisy is good

# Conclusion
The problem with this dilemma is how much I am willing to attack this person publically. I don't think that God calls us to attack the dignity of another person, but he also doesn't call for us to lay down and take persecution. I think I would ultimately decide to offer no comment as personally I don't enjoy the spotlight or attacking someone in public.
