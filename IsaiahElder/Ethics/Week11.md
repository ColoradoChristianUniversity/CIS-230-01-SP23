# Scenario
While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Option 1: Tell my boss about the timing
**Pros:**
- Sets expectations for my Boss.
- Gives them the opportunity to find a temporary fix.

**Cons:**
- I may lose standing with my Boss/Co-workers 
- I could lose the project or even my job

**Script**
- me: "Hey Boss, I did some research, and it looks like this problem will take about 6 months to solve using third-party software.
- Boss: "Can you come up with a temporary fix in the meantime?"
- me: "I'll see what I can do."

> Colossians 3:9 ESV - Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices

**First Principle:**
Honesty is the best policy.

# Option 2: Work on my own, without the software

**Pros:**
- No need for third-party software use.
- may put me in a position for promotion by solving the difficult problem.

**Cons:**
- The problem may be out of reach or too difficult for my skill set.
- Not using the software may extend the time frame even further.

**Script**'
- me: "Hey Boss, I think I may be able to drum up a solution but it will take much longer than you hoped."
- Boss: "Can you come up with a temporary fix in the meantime?"
- me: "I'll see what I can do."

> Proverbs 14:23 ESV - In all toil there is profit, but mere talk tends only to poverty.

**First Principle:**
Performing admirable work is bearing witness to God in the workplace.

# Option 3: Ask a senior developer for advice

**Pros:**
- Get a second opinion from someone with more experience.
- May provide me with an idea for a quicker or easier solution

**Cons:**
- Adds delays to the project
- May show my own ineptitude if the problem is simpler than I thought

**Script**
- me: "Hey man, I don't think you're quite ready for this promotion yet. It seems like it's going to be a lot of responsibility."
- teammate: "Maybe you're right, but I could really use the promotion."
- me: "Do whatever you think is right."

> Proverbs 12:15 ESV - The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice.

**First Principle:**
Going to a senior when faced with a difficult decision and getting a second opinion will make the decision easier

# Conclusion
As far as I can tell, there isn't an option to fit the project into the time frame that I was tasked with. That being so, I thought about finding the best course of action for still completing good work. I think that options one and two both have their merits, but they rely on the premise that the problem that needs to be solved is extremely difficult. starting with getting counsel from an experienced coworker seemed to be the best option as it will give me insight as to which is the best option.
