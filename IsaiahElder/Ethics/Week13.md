# Scenario
While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Option 1: Talk to the pastor
| **Pros**       | **Cons**       | 
| ---------------| ---------------| 
| Holds him accountable | He may be not tithing for a legitimate reason | 


**Script**
- Me: "Hey Pastor, I noticed that you don't give to the church. Is everything okay?"
- Pastor: "Yeah, we're running short on cash at home right now. I understand how it looks though."

> Matthew 18:15 - “If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.

**First Principle:**
If I am witness to sin like this, I should first come to them privately.

# Option 2: Say/Do Nothing

| **Pros**       | **Cons**       | 
| ---------------| ---------------| 
| He may be not tithing for a legitimate reason | Nothing will change | 
| I don't risk putting myself in an awkward position |  |


**Script**
- Me: "Hey Pastor! How's everything going?"
- Pastor: "Pretty good!"

> Proverbs 3:5 - "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding;"

**First Principle:**
Sometimes saying or doing nothing at all is the best option.

# Option 3: Pray About it 

| **Pros**       | **Cons**       | 
| ---------------| ---------------| 
| The Pastor may have a legitimate reason to not tithe, so <br />confronting him would be embarassing for both parties | The pastor may never begin to tithe | 
| Giving this issue to God may be the best course of action|  |


**Script**
- me: "Lord, please help the senior pastor to follow your commandments to his best ability."

> Psalm 66:19 - “But truly God has listened; he has attended to the voice of my prayer.”

**First Principle:**
Praying first is never detrimental.

# Conclusion
This is an interesting situation. In theory, I wasn't even supposed to see or possibly even have access to the information that I saw. I still think that it would be my responsibility to say something privately. I kept coming back to the thought that the pastor may have a legitimate reason not to tithe, such as paying for an emergency surgery. I would choose the first option.
