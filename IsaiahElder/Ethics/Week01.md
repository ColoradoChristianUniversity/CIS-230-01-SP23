# scenario 
While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employer’s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
# Option 1: Request to be moved to a different project.
**Pros:**
- Little risk of losing my Job
- Possibly won't have to work on the project
- Shows professionalism to my employer

**Cons:**
- No garuntee that I would be taken off of the project 
- Could cause tension with coworkers that see no problem

**Script**
- Me: Hey boss, is there another project that I could be moved to? I don't feel comfortable working on this one.
- Boss: Sure thing! We have another client that you could do some work.
> 1 Corinthians 5:11 ESV - But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one.

**First Principle:**

If I can be removed from the project by respectfully requesting a move, I don't cause any rifts between me, my boss, and my coworkers.
# Option 2: Do the work.
**Pros:**
- No risk of losing my job
- No risk of forming rifts between my coworkers and I 

**Cons:**
- Would be supporting a company that I'm not confortable with
- May not provide the best work if I'm against what I am doing

**Script**
- Boss: Hey Isaiah, youre getting put on the new project that just came in.
- Me: Sounds good, What will I be working on?
- Boss: You're going to be streamlining the credit card system for an adult content site.
- Me: Alright, I'll get on it.
> Titus 3:1 ESV - Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,

**First Principle:**

I am called to do good work, and while I may strongly disagree with some projects I still need to perform respectable work.
# Option 3: Refuse to do the work and quit.

**Pros:**
- Don't have to do the work I dissagree with.
- Would be able to look for a new job with a company that doesnt take on divisive clients.

**Cons:**
- Lose my job and have to go searching.
- May not get as good of a reference from my boss for the new hire. 

**Script**
- Me: Hey boss, I don't feel comfortable working on this project.
- Boss: Sorry Isaiah, this is all we have for you right now, and we can't pay you for sitting around.
- Me: I was worried about that, here is my resignation letter.
> 1 Corinthians 15:33 - Do not be deceived: “Bad company ruins good morals.”
> Joshua 1:9 ESV - Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.”

**First Principle:**

Refusing to do immoral work is smiled upon by God, and I can rely on him to guide me.

# Conclusion

This dilemma is questioning how open I am to performing work that I inherently object to, and how rash my decision would be. In this case, I can see the options of, leave, stay and do the work, or stay and be moved to a new project. I would most likely put in a request to move to a different program while staying on with the company. Working for a general contractor that deals with all things credit card would bring in clients that sell anything, and because this situation is more extreme I would request to switch projects. I'd expect for my employer to be accomodating, espically if I am respectful.
