# Scenario
While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your preferred pronouns in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Option 1: Join the Crowd
**Pros:**
- Doesn't cause any rift between my coworkers and I.
- Gives me the opportunity to minister to the people that may need it the most.

**Cons:**
- I would be representing a cause that I don't agree with

**Script**
- Coworker: "Nice Pin Isaiah!"
- Me: "Thanks!"

> John 18:36 - Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.”

**First Principle:**
The company that I work for doesn't represent who I am and what I believe.
People who have these values are the people that need to be ministered to the most.

# Option 2: Refuse to wear the pin

**Pros:**
- I don't have to go against the word and represent a cause I dont agree with

**Cons:**
- May make my coworkers uncomfortable
- could cause me to be written up or fired
- would be othering my coworkers

**Script**'
- Me: "I don't think that I'm going to do this whole pin thing"
- Boss: "Oh.. Uh, alright. I'll let HR know you don't want to participate"

> Isaiah 56:1 - This is what the Lord says: “Maintain justice and do what is right, for my salvation is close at hand and my righteousness will soon be revealed."

**First Principle:**
I should maintain my dignity and represent what I believe in

# Option 3: Pray About it 

**Pros:**
- May give me clarity in making the decision whether or not to wear the pin
- God would give me the right works to say to my coworkers that need to be ministered to. 

**Cons:**
- Honestly, I don't think there is a con to praying for wisdom. 

**Script**
- me: "Lord, give me the wisdom of how I should approach this, and give me the words to speak with my coworkers in a way that glorifys you."
> James 1:5 - If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.

**First Principle:**
When I lack the wisdom to effectively make a decision, I should pray for wisdom.

# Conclusion
I think I would pray about it, and still wear the pin. I don't like the idea of othering my coworkers that may align with this movement, espically when we are called to love our neigbor. These are the people that need to hear the word of god the most, and I don't want to perpetuate the sterotype of the hateful christian. Not wearing the pin and fighting against the movement does not contribute to the growing of God's kingdom and only works to push people away from the church.
