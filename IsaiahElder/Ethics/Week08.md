# Scenario
**Situation setup**

While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Option 1: Do nothing/ pray about it
**Pros:**
- Doesn't create any awkwardness with coworkers.
- I am not responsible for losing my teammate their opportunity.

**Cons:**
- I may lose the credit for my own work.
- My Teammate may stop having the potential to learn, and have to many responsibilities put on them.

**Script**
- teammate: "Hey Isaiah, I got offered a raise!"
- Me: "Wow, thats awesome, good luck!"

> James 1:5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.

**First Principle:**
In situations that require discernment, praying to God for wisdom should be the first step.

# Option 2: Talk with management 

**Pros:**
- Don't create awkwardness with the coworker
- creates the possibility for me to get a promotion 

**Cons:**
- Could be taking away the opportunity from my teammate.
- The coworker could be reprimanded or even let go if management realizes they aren't as good as they had thought.

**Script**
- me: "Hey, I don't think that my teammate is ready for a promotion, he still has a lot to learn."
- Manager: "I'll take that into consideration, thanks for letting me know."

> Titus 3:1 ESV Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,

**First Principle:**
Talking and guiding this student is the most important, and they shouldn't be punished for an honest mistake

# Option 3: Talk with my teammate

**Pros:**
- Give him the opportunity to say no to the offer
- This way I can make sure he is ready for a future possible promotion

**Cons:**
- He may not do anything about it, and continue with the promotion
- This could create awkwardness between us.

**Script**
- me: "Hey man, I don't think you're quite ready for this promotion yet. It seems like it's going to be a lot of responsibility."
- teammate: "Maybe you're right, but I could really use the promotion."
- me: "Do whatever you think is right."

> Proverbs 22:6 Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.

**First Principle:**
Talking with the teammate first and giving him the opportunity to fix the situation is the most respectful for him.

# Conclusion
While deciding which option to choose, I kept wondering who the best person to talk to was, if it was even necessary to do so. I think that talking with the coworker, while a respectful thing to do, may not result in them actually changing anything or denying the promotion. I think that talking with management would be the best course of action, as it doesn't create any tension between my coworker and I and I would be able to continue mentoring them to be ready for the next opportunity.
