# Scenario
While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. 
When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
# Option 1: Do the work and develop the program
**Pros:**
- No risk for losing my job
- Customer is satisfied and may return in the future

**Cons:**
- This move could attract future clients that also plan on laying off workers (_could be a positive or a negative, as attracting more clients is a good thing_)
- 175 Jobs are lost 

**Script**
- Boss: Hey Isaiah, heres your new project. You'll be using machine learning to improve customer efficency for a new client.
- Me: Sounds good, I'll get right on it.
> Titus 3:1 ESV - Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work

**First Principle:**
Working for a company means that I will not always get to choose my project, and I will have to work on my assignmets with just as much effort as ones that I choose.

# Option 2: Ask to be moved to a different project
**Pros:**
- I am not personally responsible for the lay offs
- Requesting a different project would have a small, if any, effect on my standing within the company.
**Cons:**
- I may be denied and have to work the project anyways
- may create tension with coworkers that see no probelm with the project

**Script**
- Me: Hey Boss, I read through what the customer sent through for the new project, would it be possible for me to be moved to a different one thats available?
- Boss: Sure, we can get someone else on it, you can work for this client instead.

> Proverbs 15:1 ESV - A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.

**First Principle:**
Putting forward a respectful request for moving would be met with the same respect from my boss, who would either tell me yes or no while still keeping me in high regard for being willing to ask.

# Option 3: Ask my boss not to take the client
**Pros:**
- The company that I work for is not responsible for losing people their job
- Keeps those workers their job until another company does the project
- May cause the client to consider the repercussions of the large layoff

**Cons:**
- Lose this company as a client
- This client may recommend for companies and executives they know not to use our service
- Boss could simply say no

**Script**
- Me: Hey Boss, I read through what the customer sent through for the new project, and it looks like they're planning on using our code to justify over one hundred and fifty lay offs in their company.
- Boss: It's not our job to police what a client does after we deliver. I don't see a reason to refuse them.
- Me: Fair enough, I'll get to work.

> 1 Thessalonians 5:12-13 - We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you, and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.

**First Principle:**
I have no sway in this decision, so all I can do is respectfully put forward my input.

# Conclusion
This situation is a more difficult decision than the last one. The layoffs within another company aren't my responsibility and I was hired to do this specific work, but I would be indirectly contributing to these people losing their jobs. Ultimatly, I came to the decision to just do the work that I was assigned. I don't like that the client is laying off those people, but if I didn't do the work then someone else on my team or another company would do it anyways. In this case it would be a personal conflict that I would have to get over as this is what I was hired for. Taking the project would provide me an opportunity to show my competency in the work I perform, and hopefully give the company I work for some presence in the market for these kinds of projects.
