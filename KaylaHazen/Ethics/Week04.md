# Scenario
While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Response

## Option 1: I would recommend them to counseling.			

**Pros:**
- They might have not thought to get a counselor which could help them a lot. 

**Cons:**
- This doesn't take care of the project in the short term.

**Script:**

Me: Thank you so much for sharing this with me. I am so sorry you are struggling with this. Have you considered getting counseling? They might be able to help you work through this.

Teammate: Thank you for listening. I actually had not thought about it. I will definitely look into it. Do you have any recommendations?

Me: Yes, I will send you a list of some counselors I recommend. 

**Scripture:**

Proverbs 11:14: "For lack of guidance a nation falls, but victory is won through many advisers."

**First Principle:**

Sometimes people have a negative connotation towards counseling. However, counseling can be super helpful. Sometimes counseling is the first time a person has ever experienced a relationship where a person will just listen to them and help them think through things.

## Option 2: I would ask them if they wanted to meet every week for lunch so that I could listen and talk with them and be a support system for them.

**Pros:**
- They would feel heard and supported.

**Cons:**
- This still does not take care of the project in the short term

**Script:**

Me: Thank you so much for sharing with me. I am so sorry you are struggling with this. Would you want to meet once a week for lunch to talk about how you are doing and how I can support you each week?

Teammate: I would love to do this with you! Thank you so much for offering.

**Scripture:**

1 Thessalonians 5:11: "Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing."

**First Principle:**

It is really important to ask for help and that when someone asks you for help you help them in whatever way you can. The best way to share the Lord’s love with someone else is to love and encourage them when they are struggling.

## Option 3: I would ask them if they need someone to help take over their part of the project and if they do then I would help them find someone.

**Pros:**
- This would help solve the problem of the project not getting done on time.
- They would feel supported and heard.

**Cons:**
- They might feel like a problem I am trying to solve quickly instead of carrying about them as a person.

**Script:**

Me: Do you know anyone that could take over your part of the project for you or can I can help you find someone?

Teammate: Yes, that would be amazing. I really need help on this project. I cannot do it by myself. 

**Scripture:**

Galatians 6:2: “Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.”

**First Principle:**

The Lord calls us to carry each other's burdens and support each other. By supporting others and loving them well we are showing them the love of Christ and the way He loves.

# Conclusion
As christians we are called to love others like how Christ loves us. Which means that we should walk alongside people and support them carrying their burdens and encouraging them.

## My Choice
I would do all three of my options. I would first ask them if we can find someone to help them on this project, then I would ask them if they want to start getting lunch every week, and then ask them if they thought of starting counseling.
