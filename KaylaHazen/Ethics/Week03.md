# Scenario
While maintaining a very popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. 

Note: An open scarce maintainer is a volunteer who basically owns a repository others contribute to. The repository, if popular, will be used in many software programs as either reference or as a library. An open source project is not owned by a company.


# Response

## Option 1: I would write the back door code because it would save many children even though it is violating people’s privacy.

**Pros:**
- It would gather information to help save many children.
- The authorities would be happy because I am willing to help them.

**Cons:**
- It would violate people's privacy because I would be gathering their information without them knowing.

**Script:**

Me: I can write this code to help gather evidence in order to save children.

Authorities: Great, thank you Kayla. 

**Scripture:**
Psalm 82:3-4 - “Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.”

**First Principle:**
The Lord calls us to defend the weak, oppressed, and powerless. We are to rescue the people who cannot help themselves. 


## Option 2: I would ask the authorities if there is any other way we could go about helping the children without having to introduce back door code and violate people’s privacy.

**Pros:**
- People’s privacy would not be violated

**Cons:**
- It would take longer to find another solution
- Less children could be saved because another solution takes time.

**Script:**

Me: What other solutions are there to gather information without violating people’s privacy?

Authorities: We have not looked into other options. Can you please help us to figure out other solutions?

Me: Yes I would love to help brainstorm other solutions with you.

**Scripture:**
1 Thessalonians 4:11 - “and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business…”

**First Principle:**
One of the ways to respect people is to not violate their privacy. However, I do not believe that this is always the case. Sometimes for example if I found out that my roommate had drank on campus I should respect them by questioning them about it and holding them accountable and to a higher standard (whether that be I am their accountability partner or they submit themselves to the non-disciplinary program at CCU) because what they did was wrong.


## Option 3: Maybe I could let people know that their information will be gathered when using the open-source project. Then people would know that their information was being gathered instead of us just taking it without permission.

**Pros:**
- We would not be taking people’s privacy away without their permission.

**Cons:**
- Less people might use it because they do not want their information to be gathered.
- The people who are using this project for their online child trafficking scheme could choose a different place to conduct this because they see the warning about information being gathered.

**Script:**
Me: I would love to help with this project, however, we should not be gathering peoples information without their permission so I am going to have a warning or terms and conditions thing that they have to check before using the project.

Authorities: This might scare away the people conducting the online child trafficking scheme but we can try and see what happens.

**Scripture:**
Proverbs 19:1 - “Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.”

**First Principle:**
The Lord calls us to be honest and to walk in integrity in everything we do and say. Which means that by being honest with everyone who uses the open-source project we are honoring both God and everyone who uses it. Which is one of the ways we can show love to others.

# Conclusion
This is very tricky because obviously we want to save these children and do everything in our power to get them out of being trafficked. However, we also do not want to invade everyone's privacy. This is a very thin line to walk. For me personally, I would rather violate people's privacy in order to save children from being trafficked.

## My Choice:
I do not know how it would actually work but my choice would be to let the people know that their information will be gathered when using the open-source project. The only concern is would this scare away the people who are involved in the online child trafficking scheme? If it would then I would need to figure out a different option. I would not want to lose the only intel we have on these people.
