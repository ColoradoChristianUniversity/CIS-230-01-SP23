# Scenario
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he is up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

## Option 1: I would talk to leadership and tell them that I also worked on this project, not just my teammate.

**Pros:**
- They would know that I also helped on the project
- They might consider me for the raise also.

**Cons:**
- They could think I'm lying and trying to get credit for something I did not do.

**Script:**

Me: Hi leadership, I wanted to let you know that I also worked on this project with my teammate. He did not do this project alone.

Leadership: Thank you for letting us know. We will talk to your teammate and hear his side of the story.

**Scripture:**
Proverbs 3:5-6 - “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight”

**First Principle:**
Even if I do not get the recognition or the raise the Lord has me in his hands and I can trust in him because he knows what he is doing and his ways are perfect. God deserves all the glory not me.


## Option 2: I would talk to my teammate and ask them to tell leadership that we worked on the project together.

**Pros:**
- Leadership would believe my teammate because he doesn’t gain anything from telling leadership in fact he might lose his raise.
- If my teammate told the truth there would be no hard feelings between us.

**Cons:**
- Since he might lose the raise by telling leadership I helped he is going to be way less likely to tell them the truth.
- If I got the raise my teammate could become angry and regret telling the truth.

**Script:**

Me: Hi teammate, you know that we both worked on this project together, however, leadership believes it was only you. Can you please tell them we both worked on it together?

Teammate: I really need this raise and if I tell leadership that you helped they will most likely give the raise to you. I’m sorry but I am not going to tell them.

**Scripture:**
Matthew 18:15 - “If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.” 

**First Principle:**
We are humans, we make mistakes and we do not always own up to our mistakes or correct false assumptions when they are in our favor. Also when someone wrongs us, we are quick to want to get them back. However, this is not how the Lord calls us to act. He calls us to turn the other cheek and continue to love and not get justice for ourselves.


## Option 3: I let the whole thing go. I move on. And next time when I do a project with someone I make sure to document everything I contribute.

**Pros:**
- I will have learned from my mistakes and I wouldn't have to worry about causing a big mess if people thought I was lying or if my teammate was really angry with me.

**Cons:**
- I would most likely have to work through a lot of bitterness especially if my teammate got the raise.

**Script:**

Me: I am upset and bitter towards my teammate, however, I am going to work on this and get over it. So that I can move on and next time I am doing a group project I will make sure that I have proof of the work that I do.

**Scripture:**
Matthew 5:38-40 - “You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well.”


**First Principle:**
We are called to love above all else. No matter what. Even if it is very hard. It is loving to talk directly to my teammate and try to fix the problem just with the two of us. But if it does not get resolved I should not seek justice for myself. But instead let my anger and bitterness wash away quickly.

# Conclusion
We should not seek justice for ourselves by trying to get back at the other person for how they wronged us. We should go to them and talk about it with them and if that does not work get others involved but we should never try to do harm to them like how they did harm to us. God is the only one that reserves the right to judge.

## My Choice
I would do a mix of all three. First, I would go directly to my teammate and talk to them about it. If they will not tell leadership I would then go to leadership myself. However, if leadership does not believe me then I would let it go and move on.
