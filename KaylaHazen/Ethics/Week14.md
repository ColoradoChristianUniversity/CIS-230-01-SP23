# Scenario
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

## Option 1: If my entire software team is on my side then we can tell the government agency that they are not able to use our software in this way.

| 🟢 Pros | 🔴 Cons | 
| --------------- | --------------- |
| They could want to use the product for other things.  | They could stop funding us. | 
| Since it is our product they would most likely have to obey our wishes. | They could not care and do it anyway. | 

🎭 **Script:**

Me: We (the software team) do not want our product being used in this way. You can use it in other ways just not to identify religious references.

Government Agency: One of the biggest reasons we are funding you is to use it in this way.

Me: We greatly appreciate your funding, however, this is our product and we do not want it being used in this way.

📖 **Scripture:**
Deuteronomy 31:6 - Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.”

🤔 **First Principle:**
The Lord commands us to be strong and courageous because the Lord is with us. Even when we are scared, anxious, and confused the Lord promises that He will never leave nor forsake us. We must put our trust in Him and obey his command to be courageous.

## Option 2: If the software team is not on the same page. I could do something to the software so that it messes up or cannot properly identify religious references.

| 🟢 Pros | 🔴 Cons | 
| --------------- | --------------- |
| The government agency would not be able to use it. | I would be messing up software that my team and I have spent years working on. | 
| I would not have to confront anyone. I would do it without anyone knowing. | My team and the government agency could find out what I did and I could lose my job and reputation. | 
| | I would be lying. | 

🎭 **Script:**

Me: *Messes up the software*

Government Agency: I thought that this software was going to be able to identify religious references?

Me: No, I apologize it actually cannot do that. 

📖 **Scripture:**
Proverbs 12:22 - The Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy.

🤔 **First Principle:**
The Lord says that he detests lying lips. He also commands us to not lie. If I were to do this it would be for the right cause, however, I would be doing it in a way that is not honoring the Lord. I would have to decide if I believe lying can be okay in certain situations or if it is wrong all of the time even if it is for a good cause.

## Option 3: I could do nothing and hope that the software I created does not affect people hearing about Jesus or being persecuted.

| 🟢 Pros | 🔴 Cons | 
| --------------- | --------------- |
| I would not have to do anything. | I would let a potentially dangerous software into the world that could persecute Christians or lead to people not hearing about Christ. | 
| I would not have to ruin or change the software I created. | I would not have even tried to do something to prevent the worst from happening. | 

🎭 **Script:**

Me: Here is the software, you can use this however you would like.

Government Agency: Thank you! *Starts using it to persecute Christians and keep people from hearing the gospel.*

📖 **Scripture:**
2 Thessalonians 3:6 - “In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers and sisters, to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live according to the teaching you received from us.”

🤔 **First Principle:**
Jesus calls us to not be idle. But to work hard and to do everything for His glory. If I were to not do anything about this I would be idle. Which is not following the Lord’s command.


# Conclusion
The Lord is gentle with us and forgives us, however, that does not mean that He is okay with us not listening to His commands. He desires for us to follow and obey Him as best we can. This is seen in His command to be holy as He is holy.

## My Choice
I would choose to talk to the people on my team to see what their thoughts and opinions are and then from there I would know if I am alone or not. Then I would how to address the company agency and have plans as to what they could possibly do when I tell them I do not want them using the software for this. The problem is my team is probably worried about the money and would not want to lose their support. This would be very hard to figure out what to do.
