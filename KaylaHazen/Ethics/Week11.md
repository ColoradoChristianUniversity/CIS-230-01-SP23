# Scenario
While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

## Option 1: I would explain to my boss that I found this third-party software but that it does take a minimum of 6 months. However, I know it will work and in the meantime I can be working on other things that I know how to do instead of trying to figure out something that seems impossible.

**üü© Pros:**
- I do not have to figure out how to do something that seems impossible.
- I can work on other projects that hopefully do not seem impossible.

**üü• Cons:**
- It will take a minimum of 6 months, however, I am supposed to do it in two.
- My boss might not trust the third party software.

**üé≠ Script:**

Me: Hi boss, I found a third-party software that will solve a problem we have! However, it will take a minimum of 6 months. When I was trying to figure out this project by myself I was not getting anywhere. Which means I will most likely not be able to get it done in 2 months. 

Boss: Hi Kayla, this third party software sounds interesting. I am going to look into it. However, in the meantime I would like you to continue trying to solve this problem yourself. I really need this project done in two months.

Me: Okay I understand I will keep working on the problem and if you have any questions about the third-party software I would love to answer them.

**üìñ Scripture:**
> Ephesians 4:25: ‚ÄúTherefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body.‚Äù

**ü§î First Principle:**
I believe that the best thing to do in any situation is tell the truth. It might be scary to tell my boss that I do not think I can make the 2 month deadline, however, it will be even worse when the 2 month deadline comes up and I am not finished. People are more likely to give grace if you tell them you are struggling rather than after you are supposed to be finished.

## Option 2: I would try to get in contact with the people who made the third party software to either ask them if I can get some information on how they accomplished what they did and if they could help me with my project.

**üü© Pros:**
- They could possibly be able to help me on my project even if it is just a little.
- If they were able to help me it would make the project seem less impossible.

**üü• Cons:**
- They might not be willing to help me because they are so focused on their own project.

**Script:**

Me: Hi, I am working on a project that involves (I would explain the project) and I saw that your software does this. I know it will come out in 6 months, however, I need it sooner. I was hoping you could help give me some insight on how to solve this problem.

People who made the third-party software: Hi Kayla, we will be releasing this in 6 months, however, I will help it with you now if you give us the credit and if you endorse our software.

Me: That would be amazing and I agree with those terms. Thank you!

**üìñ Scripture:**
> Proverbs 12:15 - ‚ÄúThe way of fools seems right to them, but the wise listen to advice.‚Äù

**ü§î First Principle:**
When we face problems and struggles we should not try to face them alone. We should seek counsel and help. The Lord gave us friendship and community for a reason.


## Option 3: I would continue working on the project to try to get it done in 2 months. I would do a ton of research and seek the advice and help of anyone I know that could help me.

**üü© Pros:**
- I would not have to tell my boss that I think the project is impossible. Although I think I still should do this.

By working really hard, doing research, and seeking help I might be able to solve the problem.

**üü• Cons:**
- There is little chance that I would have this solved in 2 months.
- My research and friends could not be helpful at all.

**Script:**

Me: Hi friend, would you be able to help me solve this problem?

Friend: Possibility, let me take a look at it.

Friend ( a few weeks later ): I have no clue how to help you. I am so sorry. 

**üìñ Scripture:**
> Colossians 3:23: ‚ÄúWhatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters‚Äù

**ü§î First Principle:**
Even though it might be impossible for me to solve the problem it does not mean I should just give up. I should work hard and at least try. The effort is what will make a difference in solving this problem.

# Conclusion
In whatever we do we should be honest, ask for help, and work hard. These three things are not only great characteristics that make a great employee but also a great person.

## My Choice
I would update my boss on how I am feeling about the project and explain to them how stuck I am. Then I would tell them about the third-party software and see what they think about it. I would ask my boss if it is okay to contact the third-party and if they said yes I would reach out to see if they could help me.
