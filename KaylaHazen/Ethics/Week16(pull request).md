# Scenario
You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's technically true, but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you specifically because you have access to details of the public figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking about, as they often attack Christians in public without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency and individual dignity. You also consider your belief in obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, and the right of self-preservation. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

## Option 1: I would figure out exactly what I want to say that is honest, respectful, and loving. And then I would talk to the news agency and make a statement on the person.

| üü¢ Pros | üî¥ Cons | 
| --------------- | --------------- |
| I would get a chance to share my honest, yet loving opinion on the person. | The news could twist what I am saying to make it sound like I am saying what they want me to say.| 
| I would hopefully get an advance in my career or at least gain a positive reputation for not attacking the person on the news. | The news agency could be frustrated that I am not attacking the other person and try to ruin my career. | 
| Hopefully when the person would see the news they would realize that I was kind and loving towards them even when I did not have to be. Maybe it would open their heart to Jesus. | The person I am talking about could be angry at me and start publicly talking bad about me. | 

üé≠ **Script:**

Me: I will make a statement, however, I do not want you to twist my words. I am going to be honest but also I am not going to attack the person.

News: We just want you to give your honest statement about him.

Me: I can do that. Thank you for this opportunity.

üìñ **Scripture:**
Proverbs 21:3 - ‚ÄúTo do what is right and just is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.‚Äù

ü§î **First Principle:**
This bible verse shows us just how important being right and just is to the Lord. It is more acceptable to Him than sacrifice and sacrifice was the only way in the Old Testament to become clean and right before God. Which means that when we are right and just in how we live our life the Lord is pleased and receives glory through our living rightly and justly.


## Option 2: I would not talk to the news agency.

| üü¢ Pros | üî¥ Cons | 
| --------------- | --------------- |
| I would not have to figure out what to say on the news. | I would not get the chance to say how I feel about the person. | 
| I would not have to worry about coming across as attacking the person or that person feeling like I am attacking them. | I would not get the chance to advance my career. | 
| I would not have to worry about the news twisting my words. | Row 3 Column 2 | 

üé≠ **Script:**

Me: I will not make a statement on this person. Thank you for the offer.

News: We would really like you to make this statement. We could help you advance your career.

Me: Thank you, but I will not make a statement.

üìñ **Scripture:**
Ephesians 4:29 - ‚ÄúDo not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.‚Äù

ü§î **First Principle:**
As Christian‚Äôs the Lord calls us to only build each other up and not tear each other down and attack each other with words. To not build each other up is not loving. Yes, it is important to call out each other's sin, however, that is when you are both in close friendship. We should not judge others because we, ourselves, are not perfect either and we still sin.

## Option 3: I would try to get in contact with the person whom the news agency is asking me to speak to so that I could let them know what the news is doing and possibly be able to share with them everything I want to say to them without doing it over the news.

| üü¢ Pros | üî¥ Cons | 
| --------------- | --------------- |
| I would possibly be able to talk to the person. | The person might not want to talk to me and ignore my offer to meet with them. | 
| This person could be thankful and appreciate that I came directly to them instead of talking to the news. | They might be angry with what I say to them and start to speak out and attack me. | 
| They could want to know more about Jesus because of how I handled the situation. | Row 3 Column 2 | 

üé≠ **Script:**

Me: Hi (person I am meeting with), I wanted to let you know that the news reached out to me to make a statement about you. However, I wanted to meet with you today because I want to talk to you in person instead of telling the news.

Person: Thank you for meeting with me today and being honest with me about how you feel about me instead of giving a statement to the news. It really means a lot to me especially since I speak out and attack Christians just like you. I would really like to keep meeting with you to talk about your faith and Christianity.

Me: Of course, I would love to continue meeting with you! Let‚Äôs try to meet once a month. You can bring all your questions and I will do my best to answer them and share the gospel with you.

Person: That sounds great! Thank you so much again!

üìñ **Scripture:**
1 Peter 3:9 - ‚ÄúDo not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.‚Äù

ü§î **First Principle:**
If I were to not speak out and attack this person, but instead meet with them and honestly and lovingly tell them how I feel about them I would not repay evil for evil. But instead would be repaying evil with good and blessing. So many blessings could come out of this. The Lord can do amazing things when you obey Him and follow him commands such as this.

# Conclusion
We are to be a people love so well and who strive to love like how Jesus loved. This means that we should not repay evil with evil but instead love our enemies. We are not the ones to seek justice. God is just and will take care of justice. He calls us to trust Him and turn our check. And when we do this we glorify God which can lead to more people, even our enemies, coming to Christ.

## My Choice
I would choose to meet with the person to talk to them directly because I believe this is the most loving way to tell the person how I feel about them and if I am upset or hold a grudge against them. It is so important to not harbor these feelings and if I were to meet with this person I would be able to be honest with them and hopefully start the process of forgiving them and pointing them towards the Lord. It would be really amazing if because of how I loved them, despite all they had done to Christians, the Lord used our relationship to bring that person into His Kingdom.
