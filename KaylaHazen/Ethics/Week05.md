# Scenario
You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it very clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:
Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is, so to speak, on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?

# Response

## Option 1: I would remind the entire class to not plagiarize. I would tell them that I know a student plagiarized but I am letting it pass for now. However, if it happens again I will meet with the student individually and I will deducted points from their grade.

**Pros:**
- Everyone gets another warning
- Maybe the student will realize what they did was wrong and won’t do it again

**Cons:**
- The student might think that they can get away with this and so they might do it again on the next assignment.

**Script:**

Me: Good morning class before we start class today I want to address the issue of plagiarism. We had a student copy code from a tutorial on the internet for their homework and like we discussed a week ago this is not okay. This is just a warning to not do this again, however, if I find that this happens again I will meet with the student individually and their grade will be deducted points on the assignment.

**Scripture:**
2 Peter 3:9: “The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.”

**First Principle:**
Just like Jesus is patient with us we should also be patient with each other. Instead of just jumping to punishing the student it is better to meet and talk with them.

## Option 2: I would meet with the student and tell them this is a warning, however, if it happens again I will deduct points from their grade.

**Pros:**
- The student will know that I caught them and that I will catch them if it happens again.
- They will not lose points now which they will be very happy about.

**Cons:**
- The student might try to do it again since they didn't get any points deducted the first time.

**Script:**

Me: Thank you for meeting with me. I wish it was not under these circumstances but I just wanted to remind you of my policy on plagiarism. If this happens again I will take points off your assignment.

Student: I understand and I will not plagiarize again. Thank you for giving me a warning.

**Scripture:**
Matthew 18:21-22: “Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, ‘Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?’ Jesus answered, ‘I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times’.”

**First Principle:**
We should be quick to forgive instead of being quick to blame and accuse. So in this instance the most loving thing to do is to sit down and talk with the student and give them grace.


## Option 3: I would meet with the student and deduct points from their grade.

**Pros:**
- The student will know that I caught them and that I will catch them if it happens again.
- They will realize that plagiarism has consequences.

**Cons:**
- This could come off as harsh since it was their first time making a mistake.

**Script:**

Me: Thank you for meeting with me. I wish it was not under these circumstances but I just wanted to remind you of my policy on plagiarism. Since you did not follow my policy I am going to take 10 points off your assignment.

Student: I really would have liked a warning before you took off 10 points on my assignment. This seems a little harsh.

**Scripture:**
Proverbs 26:11: As a dog returns to its vomit, so fools repeat their folly.

**First Principle:**
If I let the student continue to do this they will not learn and it will end up hurting them in the end. By calling them out and holding them to a higher standard it is the most loving thing I can do for that student.

# Conclusion
As a professor the best way I could love the student is by holding them accountable but also giving them grace and not being too harsh on the student especially since this was the first mistake the student made.

## My Choice
I would combine options 1 and 2. I would address the class to remind them all of my policy on plagiarism and what will happen if I do catch them plagiarizing. And I would also meet with the student and tell them it’s just a warning, however, if it happens again I will deduct points from their assignment.
