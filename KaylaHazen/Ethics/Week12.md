# Scenario
While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your preferred pronouns in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

## Option 1: I explain to HR that I do not support the LGBTQ+ community so I will not put my pronouns in my email signature and will not show up with a rainbow pin on thursday.

**üü© Pros:**
- They could respect me for standing up for my beliefs. 
- They could see that I am not doing this out of hatred but because my beliefs are different from theirs.

**üü• Cons:**
- It will be hard to get the point across that I do not hate these people but that I just do not support their beliefs. 
- People tend to think that if you do not support something that they do, you hate them. 

**üé≠ Script:**

Me: Hi HR, I do not support the LGBTG+ community so I will not be putting my pronouns in my email signature and will not show up with a rainbow pin on thursday. I want you to know that just because I do not support them does not mean that I hate them. 

HR: Hi Kayla, we would really like you to participate in this since the whole company is, however, you have the freedom to not participate if that is what you would like to do. 

Me: Thank you so much for understanding.

**üìñ Scripture:**
Romans 1:16: ‚ÄúFor I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.‚Äù

**ü§î First Principle:**
As Christians, we must stand up and defend the Truth and our beliefs. We cannot be cowards. It can be very scary to stand up for the Truth, however, the Lord says we should not be ashamed of the Gospel for we honor and glorify the Lord when we defend it. When we seek favor from the world instead of the Lord is when we go astray.

## Option 2: I do not say anything to HR and do not put my pronouns in my email signature and will not show up with a rainbow pin on thursday.

**üü© Pros:**
- I do not have to confront HR in the beginning.

**üü• Cons:**
- This could make them frustrated with me because I am not following directions. 
- It could then be a lot harder for me to explain that I do not support the LGBTQ+ community after I have gotten in trouble. Making it harder for me to explain why I am not following directions. It would be easier to just be honest from the start.

**üé≠ Script:**

Me: *Does not follow directions*

HR: Kayla, why did you not follow the directions we gave you?

Me: Well, I actually didn‚Äôt follow them because I do not support the LGBTQ+ community.

HR: Why did you not just tell us this in the first place?

**üìñ Scripture:**
Proverbs 12:22: ‚ÄúThe Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy.‚Äù

**ü§î First Principle:**
If we are not honest and trustworthy and instead lie we are dishonoring the Lord and not glorifying Him. Especially, if the people we are lying to know that we are Christian this will not give them a good picture of who God is. God calls us to be set apart from the world, however, when we lie it makes us part of the world and not part of God‚Äôs kingdom.


## Option 3: Find a new job because I do not want to work at a company that supports the LGBTQ+ community.

**üü© Pros:**
- I do not have to worry about not following HR‚Äôs directions.
- I do not have to work for a company that supports the LGBTQ+ community.

**üü• Cons:**
- I will have to find a new job which might be hard to do.
- It is not ideal to quit a job and not have another job lined up. Who knows how long I could be without work.

**üé≠ Script:**

Me: Here is my letter of resignation.

HR: Why are you leaving Kayla? Is someone offering to pay you more than we are? Did something happen that caused you to want to leave?

Me: *I would have to decide if I want to tell them why I am actually leaving. I think it would be a good idea to tell them why I am leaving the company. This goes back to what I was talking about for the 2nd option of being honest.*

**üìñ Scripture:**
Jeremiah 22:3: ‚ÄúThis is what the Lord says: Do what is just and right. Rescue from the hand of the oppressor the one who has been robbed. Do no wrong or violence to the foreigner, the fatherless or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place.‚Äù

**ü§î First Principle:**
If I felt like the Lord was calling me out of the company because they supported the LGBTQ+ community then I would need to listen to that calling and resign. The Lord knows what is best is for us. However, if the Lord was calling me to stay in the company I would need to listen to that too. The just and right thing to do is what the Lord is calling me to do.

# Conclusion
I need to listen to the Lord‚Äôs calling, the convictions He is giving me, and the Holy Spirit within me to decide what is just, right, honoring, and glorifying to the Lord. I should always be honest even when it is hard and when I am afraid that people will disagree with me or dislike me because of my beliefs. We must remind ourselves constantly that we are not on this Earth to find favor with it and to have everyone like and agree with you. We are on this Earth to show the love of Christ to people and make disciples no matter the cost.

## My Choice
I would choose the 1st option because I would still want to stay at the company and this would be a great way to express my beliefs to them and show the love and light of Christ to them. Hopefully, through the conversations I would have it would point them to Christ. Especially since in the current culture it would be hard to find a company who does not hold to those beliefs.
