# Instructions:

The root of this site has the ethics write-up of everyone in class. You can go there and you can browse and read anyone's essays. Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. In this week's essay, summarize each with a simple bullet list and pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). Given their choices, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not. Do you want to include a third essay? That's up to you.

## Scenario I choose to look back on:
While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Madeline Borgelt

## Her Options: 
- Option 1: Affirm I will not share with anyone, offer help in whatever he is working on – if the time pressures are that close, then it’s just the final push
- Option 2: Ask what he thinks is the wisest course of action given his mental health and the project’s seriousness
- Option 3: Ask who they trust enough to hand off their portion to focus on their mental health and whether they would take this to our boss

**Her Choice:**
She choose option 2 to gauge where he is at and his perspective on the project and his mental health.

## What I would choose from her options: 
I agree with Madeline, the first course of action should be to check in with the teammate and see how they are really doing and what they think is best for themselves. Then once your teammate has updated you and when they have figured out what will be best for them you can plan what to do next and how you can best help them.


# Adian Thomas

## His Options: 
- Option 1: Recommend the teammate makes use of company mental health resources (Employee Assistance Program?)
- Option 2: Recommend the teammate take time off and seek help.
- Option 3: Ask the teammate if I can take anything off of their plate/workload.

**His Choice:**
Adian said that he would probably do a combination of all of these options. He would start with option 1, then option 3, then option 2. That way, He could offer the teammate resources to help them, then he could offer his services to help them, and then he would recommend that they do what is best for their health and take some time off. He said this would be difficult given the nature of the project, but the teammates' health is the priority.

## What I would choose from his options: 
I had not thought of the option of recommending the teammate to use an employee assistance program or mental health resources that the company could provide. This is a really good idea. I would choose this option because if the company has a program like this they would be able to help the teammate hopefully at little to no cost for the teammate.
