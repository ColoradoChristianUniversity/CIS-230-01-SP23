# Scenario
While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

## Option 1: I would go directly to the senior pastor and ask him about it.

| üü¢ Pros | üî¥ Cons | 
| --------------- | --------------- |
| This would get his attention. | He could feel like I am condemning him. | 
| It might convict him which would be good because he should be giving to the church. | Maybe he is having a lot of financial problems right now, however, this still should not be a reason to stop giving. | 
| He could start giving to the church. | It might only be to satisfy the church and not have the true heart posture of giving to the Lord. | 

üé≠ **Script:**

Me: Hi Pastor, while I was working on the computers I had access to the giving records and noticed that you do not give to the church. Since giving to the church is such an important thing for us Christians to do and since we emphasize it so much at our church I was wondering why you do not give?

Pastor: He will probably give some excuse. And who knows if he will start giving but at least I confronted him about it.

üìñ **Scripture:**
Matthew 18:15 ‚ÄúIf your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over.‚Äù

ü§î **First Principle:**
When we catch a fellow Christian sinning the Lord calls us to go to the person and call out their sin. It should just be between you and the person.

## Option 2: I would make sure he gets the reminder emails/texts to give.

| üü¢ Pros | üî¥ Cons | 
| --------------- | --------------- |
| I would not have to confront him. | He might not look at the emails or texts or care about them. | 
| This way he does not feel like I am shaming him for not giving. | Without someone confronting him he may not realize that this is a big deal and that he needs to start giving to the church. | 
| He could start giving to the church. | It might only be to satisfy the church and not have the true heart posture of giving to the Lord. | 

üé≠ **Script:**

Me: I will make sure that he is getting the reminder emails/texts.

Pastor: If he is getting reminders all the time it might convict him. However, the Holy Spirit should already be convicting him.

üìñ **Scripture:**
2 Corinthians 7:9-10: yet now I am happy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us. Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.

ü§î **First Principle:**
If we have the Holy Spirit in us he should be convicted when we sin. However, sometimes it can be hard to listen to his conviction and instead go on sinning. So it helps to have other things like people or reminders to convict you in your sins.

## Option 3: If the pastor does not listen to me or the texts/emails. Then I would have to bring it up to some of the members of the church. The lead pastor of the church should be giving to the church. And if he is not I would have to get at least some of the church involved.

| üü¢ Pros | üî¥ Cons | 
| --------------- | --------------- |
| If some of the members were to get involved the lead pastor would have to do something whether that means start giving or be honest about what is going on. | He could get angry that I involved more people. | 
| He could start giving to the church. | It might only be to satisfy the church and not have the true heart posture of giving to the Lord. | 

üé≠ **Script:**

Me: Our lead pastor is not giving to the church and I do not know why. Does anyone know why the pastor is not giving or how we should approach him about this?

Members of the church: They would hopefully have some ideas on what to do and how to approach the pastor.


üìñ **Scripture:**
Matthew 18:16 - ‚ÄúBut if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‚Äòevery matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.‚Äô‚Äù

ü§î **First Principle:**
If the pastor does not listen to just me he will probably be a lot more likely to listen to some members of the church.

# Conclusion
What I am getting at through all of these options is that it is important to call each other out in a loving way when we are not obeying the Lord and sinning.

## My Choice
I would first go to the pastor by myself to confront him. That way it is just between him and I. I could even become his accountability partner. And that way it can stay just between him and I. Unless either one of us thinks we need to involve more people or if he does not start giving to the church.
