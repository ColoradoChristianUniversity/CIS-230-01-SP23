# Scenario: 

While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Student 1 Options + Summary

__Option 1__: Refuse the project
* Not very professional to go through with this, as a consultant you are to do what is best for the client, which often means workforce reduction when neccesary.
* Could lose your job.


__Option 2__: Sabotage the project
* Most likely illegal, and will cause you to lose your job for sure.
* No matter how you sabotage the project, the reprucssions will fall back on you. 

__Option 3__: Go through with the project.

* Conduct the work that has been assigned to you.
* Opprotunity to do the job extremely well
* There is a chance that you can recommend a solution that involves just moving the workers to a different project/job. 

__My choice__:
* I would go with option 3, as this is the only one where I am able to confidently keep my job.


# Student 2 Options + Summary 

__Option 1__: Do what is best for the Consultancy and do what the customer wants.
*  Allows you to do your job well
*  Stay in good standing with job/company/client
*  Also are doing what is best for the customer.


__Option 2__: Design the Machine Learning software while also creating training modules that go with it. These modules can train the employees that are about to be laid off.
*  Interesting take, could also be beneficial for the client if there needs to be a workforce to manage the machine learning. 
*  At the very least could potentially decrease the number of people that are going to be laid off
*  I'm not sure how plausible this could be, so it would really depend on the situation.

__Option 3__: Deny the customers request.

* Could cause you to lose your job
* Could cause the company to lose the client
* Could cause others to lose their job depending on how important this client is. 

__My choice__:
* I would go with option 1 or option 2. If option 2 was plausible and beneficial for the client, I would do this. If not, I would simply go with option 1.
