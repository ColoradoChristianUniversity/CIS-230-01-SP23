# Scenario
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer

## Option 1: Continue working on the project 

| üü¢ Pros | üî¥ Cons |
|-|-|
| Allows me to continue working on the project I have put much time and effort to| May end up with more misgivings about the problems |
| Could allow me to possibly influence how the tool ends up being used | May have to compromise my beliefs |

 
### Script: 
 -Me: ‚ÄúEven though I have misgivings about this project, I have been working on it for years now so it does not make sense to let all that effort go to waste.‚Äù

### Scripture: 

> 1 Corinthians 10:31 (NIV) - ‚ÄúSo whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.‚Äù

### First principle: 

We can use whatever we have in our hands to bring glory to God. 


## Option 2: Attempt to talk to the government agency about changing their intentions about secularizing public places. 

| üü¢ Pros | üî¥ Cons |
|-|-|
| Advocates for religious freedom | Might not be successful |
| Advocates for freedom of speech/religion which everyone should have | The government agency might not be willing to listen.|
| The government agency could potentially change their intentions | They might be too far ahead to change the program. |
 
### Script: 
 - Me: ‚ÄúHi, I wanted to express some concerns I have with how our project is advancing.‚Äù
- Them: ‚ÄúSure, what did you want to talk about?‚Äù
- Me: ‚ÄúI am concerned about how our tool is intended to target religious references in public places. I understand how this could be beneficial to us, however I believe that we should not be taking away the freedom of these places to express their religious beliefs. I feel for many of these because I am myself a Christian, and would not want this to happen to me.‚Äù
- Them: ‚ÄúOkay, we will take this into consideration. You make a good point.‚Äù

### Scripture: 

> Matthew 5:9 (NIV) - ‚ÄúBlessed are the peacemakers for they will be called children of God.‚Äù

### First principle: 

It is important to stand up for what we believe and for others that can‚Äôt do that for themselves.  


## Option 3: Talk with someone on the team about my apprehension on the project.

| üü¢ Pros | üî¥ Cons |
|-|-|
| This may bring me some comfort | May not lead to anything with the project|
| May help me process a better decision  | Might confuse me more |

 
### Script: 
 - Me: ‚ÄúHey, I wanted to ask if you had a minute to talk about something.‚Äù
- Them: ‚ÄúHey, of course. What is it?‚Äù
- Me: ‚ÄúSo the project we are working on is advancing further and their goal is to be able to secularize public places and it is not sitting well with me. As I am a Christian and I know how discouraging this could be for others in that position. I am not sure what to do since I have been working with the team for years now. What do you think about this?‚Äù

### Scripture: 

> Proverbs 15:22 (NIV) - ‚ÄúPlans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed.‚Äù


### First principle: 

It is always a good idea to talk to others and ask for advice. 


## Conclusion

In this scenario, the project that has been being perfected for years suddenly comes to a turning point. It is now intended to secularize public places and target religious references in these places. The problem from a Christian perspective is that this could impact Christians in the ways they share their faith or express it publicly. There is also the right for everyone to express their religious beliefs freely, and this software would intervene with that. 

## My Choice

My choice in this situation would be to talk to the government agency about their intentions and question why they want this software to function in this way. If it is for our country, they would be preventing people from freely expressing their beliefs and as a Chrsitian, I should stand up for those people who don‚Äôt have a say in this.
