# Scenario
You are a software engineer working for a marketing firm that has been hired by a tobacco company to analyze data for a new product. Your team is excited to work on this project because it could save your struggling company during a bad economy. However, you suspect the customer is intending the product for young audiences, but you are not sure. To make matters worse, you have been trying to build a relationship with a coworker who has criticized religion as judgmental; you are worried that taking a moral stand against this product could come across as hypocritical and cause you to lose the opportunity to reach him just as he is softening to spiritual conversations. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer
	
## Option 1: Refuse to do the project

| üü¢ Pros | üî¥ Cons |
|-|-|
| Allows me to stand by my beliefs | The project may still go on|
| Might be able to stop or delay the project | Our company may continue struggling financially |
| Allows me to demonstrate my concern for the young audiences| May damage my relationship with my coworker |
 
### Script: 
 - Me: Hi, I understand that our company is struggling financially; however, I, unfortunately, cannot go on with this project as it concerns for me the well-being of the audience who is being targeted. It also goes against my personal beliefs and morals. 

### Scripture: 

> Romans 12:2 (NIV) - Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God‚Äôs will is‚Äîhis good, pleasing and perfect will.

### First principle: 

As Christians, it is important to stand up for what we believe.


## Option 2: Work on the project but speak on my concerns

| üü¢ Pros | üî¥ Cons |
|-|-|
| Could potentially influence the tobacco company on who they target | Project may continue the way it is going |
| Shows a willingness to work in difficult situations as a Christian | Would be contributing to creating this harmful product |
| Lessens the possibility of damaging my relationship with coworker and their perspective on Christianity   | Goes against my personal beliefs and concerns|
 
### Script: 
 - Me: ‚ÄúHi, boss, I will continue working on this project, but I have some concerns about it. Would it be possible to ensure that the marketing of this product is not targeted to young audiences and people that would not benefit from it? 

### Scripture: 

> James 4:17 (NIV) - ‚ÄúIf anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn‚Äôt do it, it is sin for them.‚Äù

### First principle: 

Working through difficult situations may allow us to be the light to others.



## Option 3: Speak with other Christian friends and leaders about what to do

| üü¢ Pros | üî¥ Cons |
|-|-|
| May give me more clarity on what to do | May still not have a clear direction on what to do |
| Allows me to speak with others who have the same views as me | Might delay my decision on the project |
 
### Script: 
 - Me: ‚ÄúHey, I wanted to talk about some concerns I am having at work. I don‚Äôt know what the right decision is and I would like to know what your advice would be for me. 
- Them: ‚ÄúOkay! What is going on?

### Scripture: 

> Proverbs 3:5-6 (NIV) - ‚ÄúTrust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding;  in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.‚Äù


### First principle: 

It is important to seek guidance from other Christians in difficult situations and decision-making.


## Conclusion

In this scenario, one is torn between staying true to their beliefs against tobacco and risking the company in this time that they are struggling. There is also another factor, which is considering how the coworker would handle the decision that is made from the Christian perspective. This could make the coworker change their views and see one as hypocritical depending on which decision they make. 

## My Choice

In this scenario, my decision would be to speak with other Christian friends and leaders who I trust. I would like to receive advice from them with a Christian perspective to help me decide in this difficult situation.
