# Scenario: 
Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is, so to speak, on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?

# Response:

## Option 1: Give zero points for the assignment

### Pros:
- Student will learn that plagiarism has consequences
- I will be following the school’s policy

### Cons:
- May cause the student to have a negative perspective of me as a professor.
- The student might be discouraged in their work.
- The student could possibly drop the class 

### Script:
- Me: "Hey, I noticed that your assignment was extremely similar to an online source. Unfortunately I will not be able to accept your assignment. 
There is a zero plagiarism policy in this class that aligns to the school’s policy."


### Scripture: 
- Romans 13:1 (NIV) “Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.”

### First Principle:
- Following the university’s policy would allow me to honor my authorities, and show the student to do the same. 


## Option 2: Talk to the student and give a warning.

### Pros:
- The student may learn that plagiarism is against school policies.
- The student might not plagiarize again. 

### Cons:

- Student may not really listen to a warning since no action is taken.
- If the student does not listen, they will most likely attempt to plagiarize again.
- Students may not learn that there are consequences to plagiarism.
### Script:
- Me: “Hey, I noticed that your assignment was identical to an online source. This class aligns with our university’s policy on plagiarism. For this assignment, I will let it pass, however, I will give you a warning that this won’t be accepted in the future.”
- Student: “I understand that. Thank you for explaining this.”

### Scripture:
-  Colossians 4:5-6 (NIV): “Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone.”

### First Principle:
- In some situations, showing grace towards others may have a greater impact on someone.

### Option 3: Take points off and leave it with a warning.

### Pros:
- Allows for a consequence to be enforced without being too harsh as it is early in the semester.
- Allows student to understand that there are consequences for plagiarism.
- Allows me to follow the policy.
 
### Cons:
- Student may not care much about a few points being taken off.
- Other students may think that they can get away with plagiarism if the consequence is not too harsh. 

### Script:
- Me: “Hey, I noticed that your assignment was identical to an online source. This goes against our plagiarism rules, so I will be taking points off.
- Student: “Okay, I understand.”
- Me: “I hope that this does not happen again, if so, there may be bigger consequences and your work will not be accepted.”

### Scripture:
- Proverbs 21:3 (NIV): “To do what is right and just is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.”

###First Principle:
- A little bit of grace along with clear communication on an issue can go a long way.
# Conclusion:
Since the university’s policy for plagiarism is severe, it leaves the professor with a hard decision to make when discovering that their students have plagiarized. Being new to the school, there is a reputation that I would want to leave on both my authorities and my students. Letting students get away with plagiarism would not be good for them in the long run, and it would not allow me to follow the correct protocol, but being too harsh on the first week or two of class on a student also seems like an overreaction on my part.

# My Choice
My decision would be the last option, to take points off and give them a warning. I would let them know that the policy is very strict and we both had to follow through with it. Since this is in the first couple of weeks, I would not want to come off too harsh and give a zero on the assignment, since this could be discouraging for the student in many ways. However, I would make it clear that they should not plagiarize any longer since it would not be tolerated again.
