# Scenario
While maintaining a very popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
# Option 1: Introduce the back door code for the authorities

__Pros__:
*  Aid in the potential take down of a child traficking scheme
*  Could help children who are being abused 
*  Potentially prevent future children from being taken advantage of
*  Identify and put behind bars individuals who are contributing to the scheme

__Cons__:
* Compromise the security of the open-source project that I am maintaining
* Could lose trust in the open-source community
* The authorities could be wrong about there being a scheme in the first place, compomising the code unjustly
* Could cause people to no longer trust open source code
* Could get in legal trouble

__Script__:
* Authorities: We believe that there is a child trafficking schme that is utilizing this open source code that you are maintaining. Would you be willing to create a back door into the code so that we may gather evidence?
* Me: Absolutely, I will get right on that!

__Scripture__:
* *Proverbs 31:8-9 - “Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.”*

__First Principle__:
* As Christian's, it is our job to help those and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. In a situation like this, we cannot let people hide behind computers and traffic children.

# Option 2: Ask the authorities to come back with a warrant

__Pros__:
*  If they have a warrant, there is enough evidence to justify to believe that there is infact a child trafficking ring utilizing the code, therefore reduing the chance of compromising the code without reason.
*  Even if they have a warrant and they are still wrong about a child trafficking ring using the code, my integrity is maintained because I had no choice but to offer up the backdoor to them

__Cons__:
* If there is not enough evidence for a judge to sign a warrant, but the scheme is indeed using the code, then those children continue to be exploited
* It can take a lot of time for authorities to get a warrant, which could mean more time where children are being trafficked
* I'm not sure if warrants can be signed for something like this

__Script__:
* Authorities: We believe that there is a child trafficking schme that is utilizing this open source code that you are maintaining. Would you be willing to create a back door into the code so that we may gather evidence?
* Me: I'm not so sure I can do that without a warrant, I would be compromising the open source community on a whim. 

__Scripture__:
* *Titus 3:1 - Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,*

__First Principle__:
* It is important to be submissive to the authorities, but only when it is legal to do so. This is why I would ask for a warrant, so that I am breaking no rules or laws, but am still submitting to the authorities by giving them backdoor access if they have the proper documentation. 

# Option 3: Look into the open source guidelines about something of this nature and get legal help.

__Pros__:
*  Ensures that I am following protocol and keeping the integrity of the open source community.
*  See what restrictions/abilities I have as a maintainer of a open source community. 
*  Could see if there were any use policies that users were violating, allowing me to intervene and allow authorities access
*  Protects myself from law suits

__Cons__:
* There could be no protocols/rules, leaving me in the same position as before
* If there are protocols, they could be time consuming to go through and could lead to the exploitation of more children
* If the protocols state that under no circumstance can something like this be done, and there is infact a scheme going on, this would weigh heavily on my concious.

__Script__:
* Authorities: We believe that there is a child trafficking schme that is utilizing this open source code that you are maintaining. Would you be willing to create a back door into the code so that we may gather evidence?
* Me: Let me look into what the rules/regulations/protocols there are regarding something of this nature. Then, I will have my attorney read it over and we will figure out what the best course of action would be.  

__Scripture__:
* *Romans 13:1-2 - "Obey the government, for God is the One who has put it there. There is no government anywhere that God has not placed in power. So those who refuse to obey the law of the land are refusing to obey God, and punishment will follow."*

__First Principle__:
* It is important that Christian's obey the government and the law. That is why here, I would first see what the law is, and see if I can obey the government legally. 

# Conclusion
First, I would try option 3, then option 2, then finally option 1. I would see what legalities there are surrounding the situation, then if that doesn't provide a suitable answer, I would ask the authorities to come back with a warrant. This is a very difficult situation, because part of me knows that authorities could be wrong and I would be breaking rules for no reason. The other part of me thinks that even if the authorities are wrong, it is worth checking for the children's sake.
