# Scenario
While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Option 1: Do nothing.

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Keeps private information private | Could mean that there is a pastor in the church who is not fully commited, could be detrimental to the congregation |
| Maintains the integrity of the donation system, if you come out about this, others will feel like their contributions are public  |  |
| This could just be a glitch in the database, or maybe they give through a different person in the church... who knows! | Could feel like I no longer need to give if even the senior pastor doesn't |
|  | This is Con four, there are more cons in this table! |

__Script__:
* Me: "Wow, that is strange that the senior pastor doesn't donate anything... But, I dont know the full story and this is confidential information, so I can't do anything about it."

__Scripture__:
* *Proverbs 11:13 - "Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets, but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a thing covered."*
__First Principle__:
* It is important for Christians to follow the rules, and in this case, I assume that these transactional records are confidential. Therefore, I cannot act on this information.

# Option 2: Come out against the pastor to the congregation.

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Could expose other things that the senior pastor is doing that are not good | Could discourage others to donate because the senior pastor doesn't |
| Could cause a new, better senior pastor to come in | People will be angry that their private giving information is leakable |
| Potentially increase giving from other people | Could lose my job depending on the rules |

__Script__:
* Me: "Everybody, I have information that our very own Senior Pastor does not give to the church."
* Congregation "What!?"

__Scripture__:
* *Galatians 6:1 - Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.*
__First Principle__:
* In a church environment, it is important to have spiritual leaders who do as they preach. If there is somebody in a leadership position who is directly going against what God asks us to do, it may be worth it to act. 

# Option 3: Privately speak to the pastor indireclty about how he is doing.

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Doesn't expose anybody | They could know exactly what I am doing and call me out |
| Gives the opprotunity to seek understanding, maybe the pastors family is going through financial hardship | They could pretend that everything is good, and then nothing will change |
| Opens the door for me to potentially help the pastor, maybe I can help bear some of their burden (whatever that burden may be). | Could feel guilty for acting on information that I obtained that was supposed to remain confidential |

__Script__:
* Me: "Hey pastor, I just wanted to check in and see how you are doing. Family wise, financially, and spiritually how are you doing?"
* Pastor: "Well, now that you mention it..."

__Scripture__:
* *Matthew 18:15 - "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."*
__First Principle__:
* We are called to approach our brothers who sin against us, and to speak the them alone. In this instance, maybe we are provided this information so that we can check on our brother in Christ, and aid them through their trials and tribulations.

# Conclusion
* I would never do option 2, and it would be a really difficult decision between option 1 & 3. I think at the end of the day, I would indirectly reach out to see how they are doing. If something comes from that, great. If not, then I will mind my business.
