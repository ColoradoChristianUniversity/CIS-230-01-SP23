# Scenario

While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. 
You learn he is up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. 
What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Option 1: Reach out to the individual you have been mentoring and ask for the credit that is due.

__Pros__:
*  Allows me to confront the situation directly with the other person involved.
*  Could open the teammate's eyes to the situation.
*  Could stir the teammate to properly give credit where it is due.

__Cons__:
*  Could seem like I am trying to sabotage your teammate
*  They could claim that I am trying to take credit for what they have done on their own.
*  Could be offended.

__Script__:
* Me: "Hey teammate, congrats on your promotion! Since we have been working together these past 6 months, I was hoping that you could put in a good 
good word for me as your mentor and the things that we accomplished together.
* Teammate: "Oh yea sure thing!"

__Scripture__:
* *Romans 13:7 "Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed."*

__First Principle__:
* It is important for credit to be given where it is due. It is unfair for somebody to receive credit for something that they are not responsible for. 

# Option 2: Reach out to the teammate and let them know that the promotion could be too much for them to take on.

__Pros__:
*  Saves the teammate from being in over their head.
*  Ensures the company doesn't have an ill-equipped person in a role that is not suited for them.
*  Allows others who are more deserving to take the promotion.

__Cons__:
*  I could be wrong and the teammate could be ready for the promotion.
*  The teammate could take offense to what I am telling them. 

__Script__:
* Me: "Hey teammate, I saw that you are up for that promotion. I know that we have been working together for the past 6 months, and there has certaintly been 
improvement, but I am concerned that you may have trouble in the new role."
* Teammate: "Yea, I was kinda shocked too. I'm thinking about turning down the promotion until I have more experience and skill."

__Scripture__:
* *Isaiah 43:2-12 - When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.*

__First Principle__:
* If I have a feeling that somebody could be walking into something that they are unprepared for, I need to let them know. It would be wrong to see a potential disaster about to take place and do nothing about it. 

# Option 3: Reach out to the hiring manager.

__Pros__:
*  Prevents somebody that is incompetent from accepting a role that could be too much for them.
*  Potentially gain credit for the work that has been done. 

__Cons__:
*  Could think that I am trying to steal the promotion.
*  Could claim that I have a personal vendetta against the teammate
*  Doesn't look great for me, especially since I have been the teammate's mentor.

__Script__:
* Me: "Hello hiring manager, I just wanted to let you know that I have been mentoring this teammate for 6 months now, and a good chunk of the work that you are crediting them for has been done by me. I know that they are up for a promotion, and I just wanted to let you know that these achievements are not their's alone."
* Hiring Manager: "Thank you for letting me know, I will look into it."

__Scripture__:
* *Ezekiel 3:21 - However, if you have warned the righteous man that the righteous should not sin and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; and you have delivered yourself.‚Äù*

__First Principle__:
* It is important to warn others of potential dangers. In this instance, the work that the teammate has been credited is not their own, meaning that this promotion should not be offered to them.

# Conclusion
* I would never reach out to anybody else besides the teammate. I would ask that they give credit where it is due. Then I would also let them know that they could be getting in over their head by accepting this promotion.
