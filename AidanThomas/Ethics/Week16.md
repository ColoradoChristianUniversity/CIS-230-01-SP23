# Question

You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's technically true, but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you specifically because you have access to details of the public figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking about, as they often attack Christians in public without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency and individual dignity. You also consider your belief in obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, and the right of self-preservation. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer

## Option 1: Tell the news agency what you know

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Could progress career | The information I provide could be used misleadingly by the news agency. |
| Helps invalidate the credibility of somebody who publicly attacks Christians | Speaking to the news agency could be illegal considering I have special acess through my job. |
| | Could be sued for defamation |

**Script:**

 - News Agency: So, are the allegations true Aidan?
 - Me: Yes they absolutely are! 


**Scripture:**

> 2 Corinthians 4:4 (ESV) - "In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God."

**First principle:**

If given the opprotunity to expose the truth about somebody, we should do so. Especially when this person causes harm to the Church. 

## Option 2: Don't tell the news agency anything

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Don't feel bad about ruining somebodies reputation | Could be seen as defending somebody blatantly against the church |
| Don't have to worry about how I described the situation | Could take longer to progress in career |
| Don't have to worry about how the news agency could skew the information I provide | |

**Script:**

 - News Agency: So, are the allegations true Aidan?
 - Me: No comment. 


**Scripture:**

> Matthew 5:10-12 (ESV) - "â€œBlessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. â€œBlessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you."

**First principle:**

It is important, even though somebody may be against us, to not gossip. In this scenario, I am being asked to use my position to expose somebody for something that may not be entierly true. It is more right in this case to say nothing. 

## Option 3: Tell the news agency that their perceptions are incorrect

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Speak out against something that is wrong | Looks like I am defending somebody who is against the Church |
| Represent the situation as truthfully as I can | Could give the individual a larger platform |
| Could shock the individual the News Agency is going after. Could lead to them changing their mind about Christianity. | Could lose my job because I am speaking abouot something that I know only because of my position. Could be confidential  |

**Script:**

 - News Agency: So, are the allegations true Aidan?
 - Me: They are partially true, but not in the way that you are presenting them...

**Scripture:**

> Deuteronomy 6:18 (ESV) - "And you shall do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord, that it may go well with you, and that you may go in and take possession of the good land that the Lord swore to give to your fathers"

**First principle:**

It is important to stand up for what is right. If we know that somebody is going to be, in a way, wrongfully accused/exposed we must speak out and tell the entire truth. 

## Conclusion

I would certaintly go with option 2. This way, I stay out of the situation, and my job is not in jepordy. I don't personally believe in cancel culture, especially when it is used in a way where the situation is not black and white. I may go with option 3 depending on the situation, but most likely option 2.
