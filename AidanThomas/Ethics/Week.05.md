# Scenario

You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it very clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:

Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own. The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation. For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words, students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.

Then this

Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is, so to speak, on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?
# Option 1: Confront the student, and if they confess, give them a warning. If not, take it to the dean. 

__Pros__:
*  Allows the student to learn from their mistakes
*  Gives the student an opprotunity to correctly cite the code (potentially they didn't know how?)
*  Allows the student to do the right thing. 

__Cons__:
*  Could be going to easy on the student, as they blatantly broke the plagarism academic integrity code
*  If it got out, it could reflect poorly on me and my own academic integrity
*  Could feel guilty for not following policy and not going to the dean immediately

__Script__:
* Me: "Hello Billy, as I was grading your assignment, I believe I found that you copied somebodies code. I am giving you a warning for this, but you must go back and cite the code correctly. If this happens again, I will report the violation to the Dean."
* Student: "Ok Professor, thank you so much!"

__Scripture__:
* *1 John 1:9 - If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.*

__First Principle__:
* It is important as Christians to be understanding, and to provide second chances/forgiveness. This doesn't mean forgetting, as a repeat offence would certaintly lead to consequences. 

# Option 2: Report the plagarism to the Dean

__Pros__:
*  I am abiding by the academic integrity policy
*  The student will face punishment in a school environment rather than a professional one in the future
*  Could teach the student a lesson about plagarism, preventing them from making a more impactful mistake in the future in their professional career.

__Cons__:
* The student might not have understood the rules regarding plagarism, which could be unfair to the student
* Could hurt the student's reputation on a first offence
* Could cause the student to lose opprotunities, such as leadership positions.
* Sets an example to the rest of the class about how serious this is. 

__Script__:
* Me: "Hello Dean, I believe I have caught Billy plagarising work in my class."
* Dean: "Thank you for reporting it. I will take it from here."

__Scripture__:
* *Romans 13:1-2 - Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.*

__First Principle__:
* It is important for us as Christians to follow the governing authorities. In this case, that would be the plagarism policy. This means that I should immedietely report the offence. 

# Option 3: Restate in class, that some students on the previous assignment, seemed to have copied code, and that I am giving all students an opprotunity to go back and cite their sources 

__Pros__:
*  I don't single a student out
*  Reinforce an important lesson to the entire class.
*  Gives others who copied code an opprotunity to right their wrong. 

__Cons__:
* Not technically obeying the plagrism rules, as I don't immedietely report the offence.
* Could cause others to view me differently/underreacting
* Could set a precedent of second chances which could be problematic.

__Script__:
* Me: "There was some of you who submit your assignments that looked very similar to sources online. I want to restate that plagarism will not be tolerated in this class, so if you did this, go and fix your assignment immedietely. "
* Class: "Ok Professor, thank you!"

__Scripture__:
* *Lamentations 3:21-23 - “But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope: The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.”*

__First Principle__:
* It is important to give mercy to those who make mistakes. This does not mean constantly giving people an out, but in this case, on a first offence, this can be used as a learning opprotunity.

# Conclusion
* I would probably very carefully go with option 3 here. I would say that I had noticed similar code to sources online, and that before I finish grading the assignments, students have an opprotunity to make edits to their work. This situation is extremely difficult, because you want to help your students, which leads to an impass between bringing down the hammer hard, or give a second chance.
