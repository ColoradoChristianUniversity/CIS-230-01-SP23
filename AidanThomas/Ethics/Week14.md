# Scenario
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Option 1: Do nothing.

| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| I get recognized for this advanced machine learning tool | I am contributing to secularizing the public even more |
| I keep my job  | Could face lawsuits for creating a tool that violates freedom of religion |
|  | Could be contributing to a tool that would be used in other contries that are looking to eliminate Christians. | 

__Script__:
* Me: "This is an incredible tool, theres no way I can give this up!"

__Scripture__:
* *Psalm 128:2 - "You will definitely enjoy what youâ€™ve worked hard for â€” youâ€™ll be happy; and things will go well for you."*
__First Principle__:
* It is important to work hard at all of the things we do. This scenario begs the question, should we not innovate and create powerful things because they could be misused by others?


# Option 2: Speak out against the anti-religious use of the technology.


| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Standup for what is right | Could face retaliation from clients/management |
|  Don't feel guilt for contributing to something that could be horrible | Could lose my job |
|  | Could be viewed differently by coworkers | 

__Script__:
* Me: "Hey, I don't think it is right to uses this for anti-religious purposes... Couldn't we face legal retaliation for this?"
* Manager: "You might be right, maybe this isn't the best course of action."

__Scripture__:
* *Colossians 3:23-24 - "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving."*
__First Principle__:
* It is important that we take a step back sometimes and think about what we are doing. I chose the above verse because continuing this project willingly would be working for human masters. 

# Option 3: Remove yourself from the company.


| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| Radically show opposition to anti-religious uses of technology | Causes me to lose my job |
| May lead to finding a better job | Might not be able to support my family |
| | Could be difficult to find a new job| 

__Script__:
* Me: "I can't work at a place who would support a client with such intentions, here is my notice."

__Scripture__:
* *Philippians 2:14-15 - "Do everything without grumbling and arguing so that you may be blameless and pure, innocent children of God surrounded by people who are crooked and corrupt. Among these people you shine like stars in the world."*
__First Principle__:
* We must be blameless and pure according to this verse. It is vital for Christians to do what they know is right based on their Holy Spirit, and retaliate against evil. 


# Conclusion
* I would first try Option 2 here. I don't think I would leave the company, but I certaintly wouldn't do nothing. I would feel horrible if I did nothing, and knew that I contributed to this cause.
