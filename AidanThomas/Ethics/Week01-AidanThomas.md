# Scenario
While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employer’s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Option 1: Help the customer

__Pros__:
* Allows me to do my job
* Helps a client become more efficient and profitable, likely increasing their business with my employer, therefore helping my company
* Provides an opportunity to interface with the client, allowing me to be a Christ-like example in their lives.  

__Cons__:
* Helps a company that is promoting sinful and exploitive activity become more profitable
* Could increase the amount of content that the client creates due to increased profit
* Could be judged by other believers for helping a company such as this. 

__Script__:
* Boss: Hey, would you be willing to investigate this issue that our second biggest client is facing? They’re the porn website company.
* Me: Sure, I will get right on that. 
* Boss: Thanks!

__Scripture__:
* *Ecclesiastes 9:10 – “Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.”*

__First Principle__:
* It is important to do all things for the glory of God, but it is also important to not hide from the world, and to take scenarios where we must face nonbelievers as opportunities for ministry.

# Option 2: Ask your manager for somebody else to be put onto the assignment

__Pros__:
* Keeps me away from being involved with a pornographic company and their success/failure
* Allows me to have a good conscious without guilt/regret


__Cons__:
* Boss could look at me differently, thinking I am lazy
* Could lose my job, especially if I am the only one who can fix the issue for the client
* Could lose the client depending on how severe the issue is and whether or not anybody else could fix the problem.


__Script__:
* Boss: Hey, would you be willing to investigate this issue that our second biggest client is facing? They’re the porn website company.
* Me: I’m not sure I would be comfortable with that. Is there somebody else who could take on that assignment? 
* Boss: Ok no worries, I will ask Jim.


__Scripture__:
* *Colossians 3:23 – “Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters,”*

__First Principle__:
* Although it is important to be a hard worker, we must work for the Lord, not for our human masters. If we fail to do this, we can fall into sin.

# Option 3: Quit the job for supporting a pornographic company

__Pros__:
* I am no longer part of a company that supports a pornographic company
* I have a clear conscious 
* If I find a new job, I can be proud of where I work and what I do and how it aids the Kingdom
* Taking a stand against something that is so evil


__Cons__:
* I have no job
* Could be difficult to find a job in a similar industry depending on how my reputation is affected
* Could have trouble supporting my family.
* Could be judged by coworkers, friends, and even family.


__Script__:
* Boss: Hey, would you be willing to investigate this issue that our second biggest client is facing? They’re the porn website company.
* Me: We support a client like that? I’m not sure if I can be a part of a company that supports something like this. I quit. 
* Boss: Ok, pack up your things. 


__Scripture__:
* *Ecclesiastes 9:10 – “Matthew 5:10-12 – “Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. “Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.”*

__First Principle__:
* It is important to be aware of what our talents contribute to in the world. If what we do contributes harm to the kingdom, or is displeasing to God, it is unacceptable to have in our lives. 

# Conclusion
This is a difficult one. Part of me says that I should do my job, while the other part of me believes that our work should be for the honor of God. Is doing your job in this sense pleasing to God? 
I would certaintly try option 2 first, as it is the best of option 1 and option 2. I get to keep my job, but I do not contribute to something that is against my beliefs. This could get tricky, especially if this is a 
smaller company and I am one of the only people that could fix the problem. Then, I could be the sole reason for losing the client. If option 2 failed, I would probably go with option 1 and complete the work. At least in this way,
I have an opprotunity to be an example of Christ for those who work for the pornographic company.
