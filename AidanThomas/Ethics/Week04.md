# Scenario

While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Option 1: Recommend the teammate makes use of company mental health resources (Employee Assistance Program?)

__Pros__:
*  The teammate is able to get counseling/therapy for their mental health (if the company offers it).
*  The program would be free.
*  The therapist is a professional and can recommend what next steps should be for the employee.

__Cons__:
* None really, potentially the teammate could get upset that I am offering a solution instead of just immedietely giving them time off.

__Script__:
* Teammate: "Hey Aidan, I am really severly depressed."
* Me: "I'm so sorry to hear that, and I appreciate you opening up to me. I know that the company offers some free counseling/therapy, have you looked into the EAP Employee Asistance Program? They're really great!"

__Scripture__:
* *Proverbs 11:14 - Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety.*

__First Principle__:
* It is important for Christians to always love one another. In this instance, it is important to guide our teammate towards resoueces that can help them.

# Option 2: Recommend the teammate take time off and seek help.

__Pros__:
*  Prioritizing the teammate's health
*  Removes somebody who is mentally exhausted from the project, protecting the project from errors/miss steps.
*  Once the teammate's health improves, they can come back and work more efficiently.

__Cons__:
* Could potentially lose the client without the teammate.
* Could get in trouble with boss.
* Could lose job to layoffs depending on how important the client was to the business.

__Script__:
* Teammate: "Hey Aidan, I am really severly depressed."
* Me: "I'm so sorry to hear that, why don't you take some time off? I know that the company offers leaves of absence in some scenarios."

__Scripture__:
* *Romans 12:2 - Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.*

__First Principle__:
* It is important for Christians to stay focused on what is important, and not that of the world. In this scenario, it is more important to love our neighbor than focus on the client/business.

# Option 3: Ask the teammate if I can take anything off of their plate/workload.

__Pros__:
*  Allows me to bear another's burden.
*  Allows me to take on more responsibility, and if I do well, look really good to my boss.
*  Potentially helps the teammate recover mentally.

__Cons__:
* The teammates issues may not be work related at all, and taking some of their workload might not help.
* My own work may fall in quality, potentially causing me to lose my job.
* I could become mentally exhausted due to the additional work, causing mental health issues.
* Could lead to less time I am able to spend with my family because I am working so much.


__Script__:
* Teammate: "Hey Aidan, I am really severly depressed."
* Me: "I'm so sorry to hear that, can I take over some of your responsibilites? I'd love to help you in anyway that I can. 

__Scripture__:
* *Galatians 6:2 - Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.*

__First Principle__:
* It is important for Christians to bear one another's burdens. In this scenario, my teammate is struggling and I am given an opprotunity to help them through that struggle, and potentailly witness to them as well!
# Conclusion
* I would probably do a combination of all of these options. I would start with option 1, then option 3, then option 2. That way, I offer the teammate resources to help them, then I offer my services to help them, and then I recommend that that do what is best for their health and take some time off. This would be difficult given the nature of the project, but the teammates health is the priority here.
