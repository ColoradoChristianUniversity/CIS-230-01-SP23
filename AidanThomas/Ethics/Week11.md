# Question

While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
# Answer

## Option 1: Try to solve the seemingly impossible problem myself.

**游릴 Pros:**

 - Could potentially find a way to solve the problem myself
 - If I solve the problem, I would have a cool experience to talk about in future interviews
 - Potential to impress my higher ups

**游린 Cons:**

 - Could fail, and be reprimanded for not asking for help
 - Depending on how complex the problem really was, my manager could lose confidence in my abilities

**游꿠 Script:**

 - Manager: Hello Aidan, could you take on this problem?
 - Me: Sure!
 - Manager: Great thanks!


**游닀 Scripture:**

> 2 Timothy 2:15 (ESV) - Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.

**游뱂 First principle:**

Even if a task presents itself as daunting, it is important that we at least try to find a solution before throwing in the towel. 

## Option 2: Ask for assistance on the project

**游릴 Pros:**

 - Allows more people on the project, increasing the chance of success
 - Notifies my manager that I cant do the project by myself
 - Decreases my stress

**游린 Cons:**

 - My manager may start to think that I am incompetent
 - Could look bad depending on how difficult the problem is

**游꿠 Script:**

 - You: Hey boss, I've been working on this project, and it is proving more difficult than expected. Could I get some help on it?
 - Manager: Hey of course! Thanks for letting me know I'll send John over to help.
 - You: Thanks!

**游닀 Scripture:**

> Galatians 6:2 (ESV) - Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ

**游뱂 First principle:**

It is important to seek out help from others when we face hardship. 

## Option 3: Ask your manager if the third party could be used

**游릴 Pros:**

 - Takes the problem off my shoulders
 - Most likely leads to a better end solution than I would have come up with

**游린 Cons:**

 - Could cause my job to be out sourced (fired/let go)
 - Could cost the company money
 - Could look bad for me by looking for an out

**游꿠 Script:**

 - You: Hey boss, I've been looking into this project, and it looks very difficult. I did some research and found a third-party that could do it for us, but it would take 6 months. What do you think?
 - Manager: Hey good solution! I will see if that fits with the timeline. 
 - You: Great sounds good!

**游닀 Scripture:**

 > Proverbs 22:29 (ESV) - Do you see a man skillful in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men.

**游뱂 First principle:**

If somebody else can do something better than we can, it may be worth looking into! It all depends on how we can best be stewards of our employer.

## Conclusion

These are all decent options. Out of all of them I would probably first go with option 1, then option 2, then option 3. I would make it a last resort to outsource the project. I would first try doing it myself, and if that doesn't work, then I would ask for assistance.
