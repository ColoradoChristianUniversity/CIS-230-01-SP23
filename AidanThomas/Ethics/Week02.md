# Scenario
While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
# Option 1: Do your job and complete the assignment. 

__Pros__:
*  I have the opprotunity to do my job very well if I am successful
*  I help the client immensely and potentially foster future business
*  Potentially create new jobs for people who utilize the machine learning (upkeeping it, etc.)

__Cons__:
* 175+ employees lose their jobs
* Their job loss is on my concious

__Script__:
* Boss: Hey Aidan, will you work on this ML project for me? There is a huge opprotunity here, allowing the company to reduce their workforce by 175+!
* Me: Sounds good, I will get right on that. 

__Scripture__:
* *Ecclesiastes 9:10 - Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in the realm of the dead, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.*

__First Principle__:
* I was hired to complete tasks like this, and I understood the potential consequences when taking the job. Technology will always be advancing, but that doesn't mean that we should halt its progression to save these jobs. 

# Option 2: Consult the company in ways the to-be laid off workforce could be reassigned in the company. 

__Pros__:
* Could benefit the client even more by finding assignments for the to-be laid off employees to take on
* If succesful, I am going above and beyond the assignement to benefit the company
* Could impress the client by finding a better solution than laying off employees
* Have a better concious by knowing that I tried to help the employees

__Cons__:
* Client could be frustrated that our consulting firm is going further than the scope of the project
* Boss could be against doing anything more for the client than what has been agreed upon
* Client could still lay off the emplyees


__Script__:
* Boss: Hey Aidan, will you work on this ML project for me? There is a huge opprotunity here, allowing the company to reduce their workforce by 175+!
* Me: Wow that is a lot of people getting laid off, I've been looking into this project and there could be opprotunities for those who are going to be laid off to instead be reasigned in different places in the company. 
* Boss: If you think that could be beneficial to the client, write up an analysis and I'll provide it to them!

__Scripture__:
* *Philippians 2:3 - Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves.*

__First Principle__:
* As Christians, we are to love others. This option at least takes into consideration the well being of others, and attempts to advocate for them. 

# Option 3: Ask to be assigned to a different project 

__Pros__:
* I am not contributing to the job loss of so many families
* Those employees could potentially keep their jobs

__Cons__:
* Depending on the size of the company, I could be the only one able to provide the deliverable to the client, meaning that we could lose the client
* Boss could be frustrated that I won't contribute to the project and I could lose my job
* I am not doing what I was hired to do
* Another engineer could come in and those families would still lose their job.

__Script__:
* Boss: Hey Aidan, will you work on this ML project for me? There is a huge opprotunity here, allowing the company to reduce their workforce by 175+!
* Me: Woah that's a lot of people getting laid off... I'm not sure this project is for me. Is there anybody else you could assign to this one?


__Scripture__:
* *1 Corinthians 13:4-8 - Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.
5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.*

__First Principle__:
* In all things, we should not seek to be self serving. It can be argued that it would be better to leave the project than contribute to the job loss of so many families.
