# Scenario

While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your preferred pronouns in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Option 1: Follow the guidelines

__Pros__:
*  You get your dream job
*  You have to opprotunity to be a light for Christ in a clearly secular workplace 

__Cons__:
*  You go against your beliefs
*  Could be convicted
*  Could be judged by others for allowing such behaviors

__Script__:
* Recruiter: "Did you get your pin and add your pronouns to you email signature?"
* Me: "Yep! Ready for my first day."

__Scripture__:
* *John 1:5 - "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."*

__First Principle__:
* It is important to go into places that are secular, even though it may be uncomfortable for us as Christians.


# Option 2: Ask the recruiter if you can opt out of these activities.

__Pros__:
*  You are able to avoid doing things that may be contrary to your beliefs
*  You show others that you are willing to stand up for your beliefs

__Cons__:
*  The company might look at you differently
*  Could be forced out of the opprotunity (this is very unlikely though)
*  Could be surrounded by people who are nonbelievers

__Script__:
* Me: "Are these activities required? I'm not totally comfortable doing these thigns."
* HR: "No, but they are highly encouraged!"

__Scripture__:
* *Psalm 94:16 - "Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand for me against those who practice iniquity?"*

__First Principle__:
* It is important that we stand firm in our faith, and not succumb to the world. 


# Option 3: Forfeit the opprotunity

__Pros__:
*  Fully commit to standing up for your beliefs
*  Could find a environment that is better suited for you

__Cons__:
*  Lose the opprotunity to witness to others
*  Lose the opprotunity
*  Could have trouble finding other opprotunities

__Script__:
* HR: "Will you follow these guidelines?"
* Me: "I am no longer interested in the role."

__Scripture__:
* *Ephesians 5:11-12 - "Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. It is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret."*

__First Principle__:
* We shouldn't endorse sinful behaviors. 


# Conclusion
* Out of all of these, I would go with option 2. This way, I stand up for my beliefs, but I also don't fully reject the opprotunity. It is a very low chance that they would fire me if I didn't follow these guidelines, as I am certain that is illegal to do.
