# Scenario

While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employerâ€™s second largest customer: 
a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable.
What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

## Option 1: I tell my employer that I will not do the job.

**Pros:**
- I have a clear conscience because I did not help a pornography website become more efficient and profitable.
- Now the people that I work with know that I am a Christian and what my morals are.

**Cons:**
- My employer could become very angry with me
- I could lose my job

**Script:**

Me: Hi boss, I was looking into this project you gave me and because it has to do with making a pornography website more efficient and profitable I cannot complete 
this task because I believe that pornography is  damaging to the brain and I believe no one should watch it.

Boss: Kayla, this is very unprofessional this is your job you should do it whether you believe it is correct or not.

Me: Boss, I believe that we as a company should say that we are not going to help this pornographic website.

Boss: Kayla, I am not losing out on the money we will make from this job so I am finding someone else to do it. You are fired.

**Scripture:**
Matthew 16:24-26 (NIV) - ..."Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their
life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it. What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul? Or what can 
anyone give in exchange for their soul?

**First Principle:**
The Lord calls us to deny ourselves and pick up our cross. If we say we are followers of Jesus then we should be willing to go against anything and everything 
in this world that is not of the Lord. By going against what seems to be easier in the moment (worldly wisdom) you are obeying the Lord (using Godly wisdom).


## Option 2: I ask my employer to give the job to someone else because I am not qualified.

**Pros:**
- I do not have to explain why I do not want to do the job
- I keep my job and I do not have to worry about myself making a pornography website better

**Cons:**
- I lied to my boss
- My boss thinks that I am not as good a programmer as they thought
- The job still gets done and I did little to stop it

**Script:**

Me: Hi boss, I do not feel qualified to take on this job would you please pass this on to another programmer.

Boss: Kayla, you are a great programmer you can do this.

Me: I'm sorry boss I can not.

Boss: Okay I will pass it on to one of your co-workers but I am very disappointed in you and from now on you are going to get the lower level projects that you do
not make as much money on.

**Scripture:**
Proverbs 12:22 (NIV) - The Lord detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy.

**First Principle:**
Even though I would have not done the job I still would have sinned by lying. This would not be Christ-like to my boss and would make the whole situation even worst.


## Option 3: Even though I do not want to I do the job anyway because I am too afraid of standing up to my boss and losing my job.

**Pros:**
- I keep my job
- My boss continues to think highly of me and my programming skills

**Cons:**
- I have a lot of guilt because I did this project when I should not have because it goes against my morals
- I helped a pornography website get more people to fall into the trap of pornography.

**Script:**

Me: Hi boss, I will complete this project as soon as possible.

Boss: Thank you Kayla. I look forward to seeing what you come up with.

**Scripture:**
Hebrews 12:1 (NIV) - Therefore, since we are surrouded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily
entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us

**First Principle:**
As Christians we are being watched on everything we do and by doing this project it would reflect the Lord badly and not bring glory to Him.
