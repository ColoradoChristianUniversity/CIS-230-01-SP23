# Scenario
While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to a project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

## Option 1: Tell the customer that if he lays that many people off at the same time you will have a lot of angry people, such as ex-employees or people in the community, who will seek to do harm to your company.

**Pros:**
- The customer might listen to me and then we could figure out different options to go about this
- The customer might respect me and thank me for bring this up to them

**Cons:**
- The customer might not listen to me and still have me follow through with the project
- The customer might think that I am trying to run the company and tell them what's best for them as an outsider.
- If the customer does listen to me I will have extra work on my hands to help them come up with other options.

**Script:**

Me: Hi customer, I believe that you should not lay off more than 175 employees at one time. This could cause many people to be angry and possibly seek to undermine your company.

Customer: Hi Kayla, I did not even take this into consideration. I was too focused on the bottom dollar and not my employees. Can you help me brainstorm other possible options we could take.

Me: Hi customer, yes I would love to.

**Scripture:**
Philippians 2:4 (NIV) - not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.

**First Principle:**
The Lord calls us to look out for each other and love each other. We are too put others above ourselves. In this instance the customer was not thinking about others (his employees) but instead just thinking about what was best for the company and how to make the most money. The customer had no malicious intent but was not caring for and loving his employees as best he could.

## Option 2: Do the project even though I don’t think it's the best decision.

**Pros:**
- The customer will be happy 
- I will get paid
- I don’t have to do any extra work other than just doing the project

**Cons:**
- The customer might suffer for this later on
- I will probably feel guilty once all of those people are fired

**Script:**

Me: Hi customer, I can get started on this right away.

Customer: Hi Kayla, awesome! Thank you so much!

**Scripture:**
James 4:17 (NIV) - If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn't do it, it is sin for them.

**First Principle:**
Even if in the moment something seems like the easiest thing to do it does not always mean that that is the best decision. The Lord calls us to be mindful and to glorify Him in everything we do. Which is why when making decisions, especially tough decisions we should be listening to the Lord and obeying Him.

## Option 3: Tell the customer I am not doing the project.

**Pros:**
- I will not have to do the job so I will not feel guilty about it later.

**Cons:**
- This customer will take their business elsewhere.
- My bosses/company will not be happy with me because I lost my company business.
- We could get a bad reputation for not completing projects for our customers.
- I could lose my job.

**Script:**

Me: I’m sorry customer I cannot do this project for you.

Customer: This is ridiculous. I am finding someone else who can help me.

My boss: Kayla, you lost us business and this was not professional of you. You are fired.

**Scripture:**
Colossians 3:23-24 (NIV) - Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving.

**First Principle:**
If I just said I was not going to do the job and did not make an effort to help the customer in a different way I would not be working at it with all my heart and for the Lord. I would not be loving the customer well.

# Conclusion
The thing that makes this scenario so difficult is that because of Machine Learning more than 175 employees will be laid off and will be out of a source of income until they find another job. This would increase the bottom dollar of the company and would most likely make a lot of the processes a lot easier. However, we are taking about real people not being able to provide for their families because they lost this job. Which means the decision of firing all of these people should not be taken lightly. Other solutions should be taken into consideration before re

## My Choice
I would choose the first option to talk to the customer about what could happen to his company if they laid off all those people. And then walk through other solutions that could be taken into consideration before lying them off. The employees deserve to have some consideration put into this decision and maybe even asking the employees how they think the company should handle this. So that the employees feel like they were able to be a part of this big decision.
