# Senario
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Responses

### Option 1: Finish the project.
#### Pros and Cons
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| The completion of a large project. | The Holy Spirit could be causing the misgivings to stop this work. |
| Growth for the company. | It is a targeting program that violates the first ammendment. |
| A program that could be used to regognize patterns in public not limited to religious references. | A program that could be used to regognize patterns in public not limited to religious references. |

#### Scripture

Religous references are not made to be hidden.

### Option 2: Tell the boss that this project conflicts with personal beliefs and you can't continue.
#### Pros and Cons
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |

#### Script
Me in an email: 

    Dear Employer,
    I am excited for the near completion of the project that we have been working on. As we near completion, I have had some
    misgivings about the nature of the project. This could target all religious references from every religion and put them under
    attack. As a Christian believer, I cannot continue to work on this as it conflicts with my own beliefs. You have been
    understanding in the past about concerns I have brought to you and I know you will do what you think is best. I hope this
    finds you well and you have a great day.
    Best Regards,
    Employee
    
#### Scripture
"Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name." (Heb 13:5, ESV)
#### First Principle
We should always display our praise towards God and never limit others praise. We aren't known by the words we speak but the actions we take.

### Option 3: Become a whistleblower about this technology.
#### Pros and Cons
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| It stresses the concers about violation of the first ammendment. | This is a stressful process that may not be worth it. |
| It slows the release of the project. | It could lead to threats and personal attacks if found out. |
| It protects people's privacy. | Whisleblowing is a serious route that could take longer to investigate than the release of the project. |

#### Script
I am not entirely sure what this process would look like. I believe that it would look like talking to someone privately outside of work but continuing to go to work and do my part to stay in secret.
#### Scripture
"But Peter and the apostles answered, â€œWe must obey God rather than men." (Acts 5:29, ESV)
#### First Principle
Do what is right in the eyes of the Lord before what is right in the eyes of man. No matter the consequence, God will provide and protect.

### Choice
I would probably go with option 2. If things esculated, I would probably investigate the process of whistleblowing such a serious thing.

### Conclusion
It is important to know the values of the company you work for. Even if you enjoy the work, coworkers, and salary, as Christians we are held to a higher standard. It would be completely inappropriate for us to work for a company that is trying to target all religions to display only a secular world.
