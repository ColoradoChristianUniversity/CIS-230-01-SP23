# Senario
You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an
entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes
it very clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your 
institution publishes the following policy:

    Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own. The penalty
    for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing 
    grade for the course and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an 
    academic integrity violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation. For this class, it is
    permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person,
    however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words, students 
    may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. Such 
    unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or 
    portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.

Then this

Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# 
tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is, so to speak, on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't 
want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. 
A lot to think about. What do you do?
## Responses
### Option 1: Confront the Student
#### Pros
- This is a direct way appraoch the student and find out more information.
- It doesn't apply immediate consequence but grace.
- Prevents acting harshly or too gracefully.
- If a student admits to a violation, there are nondisciplinary actions.
#### Cons
- The student could lie about what happened and make the situation worse.
- Allowing any form of plagarism is against policy.
- You would have to do the same for all students, every time this happens.
#### Script
- Me in email:

      Hey Student. While grading your assignment I had a few concerns. I would like to meet with you about your assignment.
      Please come see me during my office hours or schedule an appointment with me.
  
- Student: "Hey Professor. You asked me to come in to talk about last week's assignment."
- Me: "Yes. Thank you for coming in. Did you use CsharpTutorial.com to do your assignment for you?"
- Student " Yes I did. I couldn't figure out the assignment and I was running out of time."
- Me: "Okay. I understand. Unfortunately this is plagarism and it is a direct violation to the academic integrity. Now that you have seen how the 
assignment should work, I will give you until the end of day to rewrite the code in your own way. This cannot happen again. If you need help please
reach out to me or we have a tutor for the class. If I see this again, I will have to turn you in for a violation for the University policy."
- Student: "I understand. Thank you Professor for talking to me about this first. I will have that in at the end of day."
    
#### Scripture
â€œIf your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."
(Matthew 28:15, ESV)
#### First Principal
According to scripture, we are to approach each other in private first about issues against one another. This gives the opportunity for change
and forgiveness.

### Option 2: Ask another professor with confidentiality of the students information.
#### Pros
- Gives insight from an experienced professor.
#### Cons
- It could esculate the situation bringing in more people.
- It could force your hand into reporting the student immediately.
#### Script 
-Me "Professor B, can I talk to you for a moment? ... I have a student that used an online tutorial source to complete an assignment, but
most of the assignment violates the academic integrity. The student has never done anything like this before and I do not want to act harshly,
but still want to uphold University policy. What do you recommend I do?"
- P. B: "It is unfortunate to see this happen, but you have to turn the student in. The university will decide how sever the situation is and
- handle it. As the policy states, the student will most likely be failed for the couse and be forced to retake it at another time."
#### Scripture
"As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another." (Proverbs 27:17, NIV)
#### First Principal
It is normal to not understand how to approach a new situation. We should have a group of mentors for the things in our lives and surround ourselves
with like-minded people. This will sharpen each other for difficult situations.
### Option 3: Give the student a 0% and send them an email.
#### Pros
- The situation has cosequence but not severe consequence.
#### Cons
- It is an easy way out and doesn't prevent the student from doing it again.
- The problem isn't addressed.
#### Script
Me in email:

    Dear student,
    For Assignment X I have given you a zero because you violated the academic integrity policy. Please refrain
    from plagarising your assignment again.

#### Scripture
"Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid." (Proverbs 12:1, ESV)
#### First Principal
Discipline is good and has learning properties with it. God shows discipline with everyone, not because He hates them, but because He loves us.
### Conclusion
Appraoching a new situation can be difficult and leave us confused. It is important to remain calm and think through situations logically. To 
refrain from acting harshly, all options should be reviewed for the situation as a whole. The situation is often not as simple as it seems on
the surface.
### Choice
I would go with option 1 as a first response because it lets us get more than surface level information. If it is something that can be solved
at that moment, then there is nothing more to do. If the situation esculates, then it may be necessary to move to option 2. I myslef had to seek
mentoring in a difficult situation. This has worked well for me in the past.
