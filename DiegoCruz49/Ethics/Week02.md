# Question
While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. 
When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer
## Option 1: Inform the Customer of Machine Learning Flaws
### Pros
- Informs the customer of all pros and cons to machine learning.
- Builds a relationship with the customer that shows you are looking out for their best interest.
- Creates opportunity for the consultancy to train employees how to identify flaws in machine learning
  - This won't protect every job but does secure some for those who are qualified.

### Cons
- It could cause the customer to drop the consultancy.
  - The customer could choose to not use machine learning, therefore the consultancy is not needed.
- As a consultant, I have no say in how the company is run and I shouldn't involve myself.
- The customer could ignore me and have me complete the project anyway.

### Script
-Me: "Good morning Mr. C. I wanted to ask you a question about the Machine Learning Project assigned to increase your efficiency.
I think it is a great resource to complete tasks without being told. There is a major flaw with this system though that I wanted to 
make sure you were aware of. Machine Learning requires close monitoring and correction as it will try to complete tasks differently
how the company completes tasks. Although it is useful, it is not a replacement for employees."

-Customer: "I was unaware of the need for monitoring Machine Learning. Please continue with the project as planned. Prepare a training
course for how to work with the Machine Learning for the employees that will have to change their position."

### Scripture
"And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." (John 8:32, NKJV)

### First Principle:
Although informing the customer does not ensure they will change their mind, speaking up and telling the truth in all aspects is the 
correct thing to do. Making all pros and cons of a situation known increases the integrity of the company.

## Option 2: (If Available) Address the concern of people's jobs to the union.
### Pros
- There is a legal presence involved.
- The report can be unanoymous but honest.
- It doesn't stop the implimintation of Machine Learning.

### Cons
- The customer could find out that you spoke up and ruin the relationship with them.
- The union could support the transition to Machine Learning and make the situation worse.
- Not all employees could be union and some people could be protected and others are not.
- This may not be an option if the company does not have a union.

### Script
- Me: "Union, I would like to address a concern with the implimenting of Machine Learning into the company to increase efficiency."
- Union: "Why are you addressing this situation with the union if this is an effeciency problem?"
- Me: "The implementation of Machine Learning would mean that 175 employees would lose their jobs. It would be unjust for them to be replaced
without warning and without being able to figt for their job. Machine learning would also need employees to monitor it in different areas of work.
Is there anyway to train the current employees how to use Machine Learning and give them an interior hiring opportunity before anyone is let go?"
- Union: "That is definitely a concern that needs to be addressed. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will begin the approach of how
to deal with this as soon as possible."

### Scripture
"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment.
And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Matthew 22:37-39, NKJV)

### First Principle:
Treat people how you would want to be treated. Put yourself in the position of those being wronged and determine how you would want to be treated
with love in that situation. This doens't mean everything will always be perfect or work in your favor but it will be just and can be set forth
with no hard feelings.

## Option 3: Redirect the customer to a different option that maintains the desired efficiency.
### Pros
- You will not be a direct cause of 175 lost jobs.
- The integrity of the consultancy can stay intact.
- The differnt option could be more beneficial to both the consultancy and the customer.

### Cons
- The customer and employer could be upset with the deferring.
- There may not be better options or other options to defer them to.
- This could be viewed as a salesman approach and ruin the relationship with the customer.

### Script
- Me: "Mr. C, I noticed you were interested in Machine Learning and would like it implemented. Before I move forward, I wanted to know if you had
looked into Software X. Software X would also increase your efficiency to the desired outcome and would put less jobs at risk."
- Customer: "What is the cost difference to use Software X compared to Machine Learning?"
- Me: "Software X is initially cheaper than Machine Learning but does require more employees to operate. You already have the employee base to
run Software X though. Using the employees that would be replaced by Software X would be perfect for the job. They already understand the task
requirements and know how it should be completed. They would be able to improve the efficiency and increase revenue."

### Scripture
"Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply your heart to my knowledge" (Proverbs 22:17)

### First Principle:
Do not bring just problems to those who make decisions. Bring them answers to problems that you have identified and take initiative over the 
situation.

# Conclusion
The ethical problem in this situation is putting others jobs at risk. Situations like this are often happening in the background and so
those who would lose their job are blindsided. Not all employers keep things a secret but it is not uncommon for only the best employees 
to be kept and the rest to be dropped. As a non-Christian, it would be easy to do the task as assigned and not worry about the ethical
dilemma at hand. As a Christian, it would have to be something appraoched appropriately and with care.

# My Choice
I would go with Option 3 for this situation. One thing I have learned in the field is an employer hates being brought more problems. They
don't hire people to make their life harder but easier. Option 3 will address the problem but also provide a solution that is ethical.
The decision is still left to the employer but they are less likely to disagree with you if there is already a solution. For this case,
all the jobs could be protected with training over a software that requires employees compared to an autonomous program that eliminates 
employees.
