# Response to Week02
## Senario :While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency.
When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

### Responses
#### Gabe
 - Do whats best for the Consultancy and do what the customer wants.
 - Design the Machine Learning software while also creating training modules that go with it. These modules can train the employees that are about to be laid off.
 - Deny the customers request.
#### Isaiah
 - Do the work and develop the program.
 - Ask to be moved to a different project.
 - Ask my boss not to take the client.
 
#### My Choice
My choice would be with Gabe's second option. Choosing to design the Machine LEarning software with a training module seems like the best option. This would not only
reduce the amount of jobs lost but would also allow myself to not feel guilty about people losing their jobs. Another reason is that it is not bringing problems
to the client but a viable solution that could save them down the road. As for the other options, they aren't bad. Completing the task as asked, or asking to be reassigned
are both things we all have the option to do. Now asking to be reassigned on a project doesn't mean it will happen and it may force your hand but it is better to ask
than demand. I do not think straight denying the customers request is up to us though based on the information given in the senario. Although that is a very real option
in the real world, there can be some serious consequences for it.
