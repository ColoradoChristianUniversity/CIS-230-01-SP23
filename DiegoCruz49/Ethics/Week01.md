# Senario

While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employerâ€™s second largest customer:
a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them 
considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Responses

### Option 1: Ask Employer to Assign the Task to Someone Else (Trade Assignments)
#### Pros
- The task will not be under my control.
- The task can still be completed.
- Nobody has to be overwhelmed by having too much work.

#### Cons
- It is a conflict of interest as a Christian whether myself or someone else does the job.
- Pornography websites have a reputation for viruses and phising scams.
- It could be a temptation to sin to view the client's profession.
#### Script
- Me: "Hey Mr. Employer, I reviewed the new project for Client X. I was wondering if I could trade this task with someone else?"
- Employer: "That isn't normally how we do things around here and you have never had an issue before. Why is there a problem now?"
- Me: "I understand. I'm only asking for a change because I am a Christian and Client X's profession is a conflict of interest. I would be 
uncomfortable working on this project because it goes against my beliefs.
- Employer: "I see. Thank you for asking me first about this. Talk to coworkers A,B and C about trading assignments. If one of them is willing,
I am okay with this accomodation. I will try to prevent this in the future."
#### Scripture
"For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things
that you wish. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law." (Galatians 5:17-18, NKJV)
#### First Principle
There has to be respect in the work place from the founder to the newest and lowest employee. If someone is uncomfortable completing a task that 
has a conflict of interest to their religeous views, management should respect that. This should always be rooted with honesty.

### Option 2: Complete the Task as Assigned
#### Pros
- Employer will be happy.
- Client will be happy and less frustrated.
- It could lead to promotions to help the largest clients.

#### Cons
- It is a conflict of interest as a Christian.
- The guilt that would build up from helping a pornography website.
- Pornography websites have a reputation for viruses and phising scams.
- The temptation to watch pornography from helping the client.
#### Script
- Employer: "Diego, Client X has been having some issues and I need you to resolve them quickly."
- Me: " I will get right on that and let you know as soon as everything has been resolved."
- Employer: "Thank you Diego. If Client X is happy, the company will take you out for keeping our second largest client."
#### Scripture
"Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand." (Ephesians 6:13, NKJV)
#### First Principle
It is important to speak up if something is uncomfortable at the first incident. After the first time, it is harder to speak up about certain issues.

### Option 3: Trade Assignments with Another Employee without Telling the Employer
#### Pros
- I don't have to deal with the project.
- Project still gets done.
#### Cons
- Employer will be upset when he/she finds out.
- It is bad integrity to not approach the situation professionally.
- The coworker may not do the project at the best they can and Client X drops our services.
#### Script
- Me: "Hey A! I don't feel comfortable doing this project for Client X but I don't want to tell Mr. Employer in case he gets mad. Would you mind
trading me projects?"
- A: "Diego, I want to help you but I don't know if this is the right thing to do. You should talk to Mr. Employer about it."
- Me: "Please A? You know I do good work around here and I never want to be a bother. I don't want Mr. Employer thinking I can't do my job."
- A: "Okay Diego. We can trade this time but only this once."
#### Scripture
"Therefore, putting away lying, 'Let each one of you speak truth with his neighbor,' for we are members of one another." (Ephesians 4:25, NKJV)
#### First Principle
Honest should be number one in our lives. As Christians we are to lead by example and doing things in the work place that can be considered "sneaking"
is enough to be considered lying.

## Conclusion
Working within a company may lead to some uncomfortable situations. It doesn't matter how long you have been with the company, it is important to
always be true to ourselves and God. When a senario like this comes forth there are many different ways you can go and these are only three ways.
Pornography is an easy temptaion and the work place is a way for it to come as an attack to the Spirit. It must be handled in a Christian and professional
manner. As soon as the problem is identified we should pray, write down concerns, and then approach the direct supervisor about the situation. Durning
this, you should always come at it with a peacful manner and not full of emotions.
## Choice
For this senario, I would go with option 1. It has been my experience that if you are honest from the begining, things will work in you favor.
Employers want their employees to be comfortable anf happy in the work place because they will be better workers for the company. If there are small
accomodations they can make to have everyone happ, they will usually work with you. As someone who has suffered from the temptation of pornography,
I can't put myself in situations where it is easy to get ahold of. I have to seperate myself from all points of contact. In an extreme situation, the 
employer might say no. If this occured, I would pray over the situation and trust God to do His will. I have no doubt that God would handle it. God
will tempt us with sin and anything that is tempting is not from God.
