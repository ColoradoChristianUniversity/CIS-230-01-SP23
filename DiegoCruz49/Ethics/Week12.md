# Week 12
## Senario
While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your preferred pronouns in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Responses
### Options 1: Do not comply with the change in policy.
#### Pros
- It sets the principle that changes in policy outside of the employment contract agreement are not acceptable.
- It sets boundaries on what is deemed acceptable for you to have a healthy work enviorment.
- Stands firm in faith that there are only two genders and they are God given.
#### Cons
- It will cause conflict and be an uphill battle to win.
- Even if the employer allows, some employees could retaliate or create a toxic work enviorment.
- It could lead to being an outcasted employee turning a dream job into a nightmare.
#### Script
Me in an email: 

    Dear Employer,
    Thank you for trying to be diverse and inclusive in the work place. I will share my pronouns as he/him and respect others
    preferences as long as they are appropriate to he/him and she/her. I do not believe in plural pronouns for singular people
    and will not use they/them to descibe a singular person. I also will not be wearing the rainbow pin as a symbol of diversity.
    The rainbow is a sacred symbol to Christianity that is God's promise to never destroy the earth by flood again. I hope this
    email finds you well and you have a great day. Thank you for your understanding and respect for my personal beliefs.
    Best Regards,
    Employee

#### Scripture
"There are those who hate the one who upholds justice in court and detest the one who tells the truth." (Amos 5:10, NIV)

#### First Principle
If an employer is changing policy to make people feel better, then they would also have to put in that effort to you. You shouldn't have to comply to something that is against your beliefs. For students like myself, they cannot say they didn't know we are Christians because our degree in qualifications is from CCU.

### Options 2: Comply with the policy change.
#### Pros
- It keeps the work place friendly.
- No worries about being reported to HR for not complying with policy change.
- It could be a small bump in the road to keep your dream job.
#### Cons
- It is supporting something that is against Christian belief.
- It is adding a policy that does not comply with everyone and is segregating the Christians.
- It leaves the door open for policy to change freely at any moment.
#### Script
No script needed. This is a silent action to add pronouns to employee profile and wear the rainbow pin to the meeting. Adding the pronouns to the email signature might look something like:
      
      Diego Cruz
      He/Him
      Software Engineer at Major Engineering Firm
      (123) 456 - 7890
      123 ABC St. Lakewood, Colorado, 80226
      
#### Scripture
"Show proper respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor." (1 Pet 2:17, NIV)
#### First Principle
Some small arguements are not worth it and we should respect people in their choices.

### Options 3: Ask HR how they are going to comply with your personal beliefs in the situation at hand.
#### Pros
- Addresses concerns as a Christian in a polite way.
- A peaceful approach.
- Higher chance for success to not have to comply to the new policy.
#### Cons
- Sometimes it is better to ask forgiveness than permission.
- Doesn't mean they will conform to your concern.
- Can create an idea that you are not a team player in the work place.
#### Script
- Me, "HR, can we talk about the new policy from the email this morning?"
- HR, "Sure. What seems to be your concern?"
- Me, "The new policy is asking me to confrom my beliefs to something I am not comfortable supporting. I accept people's decisions to make these choices for themselves but asking me to support it is going too far. Also, the rainbow pin is inappropriate as it is a perversion to a sacred symbol in Christianity."
- HR, "We will see what we can do. For now, we need you to still respect the policy until further notice."
#### Scripture
"Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth." (Gen 9:16, NIV)
#### First Principle
Approach every situation with peace and truth. In return you can expect grace.

### Choice
I would go with option 3. This seems like the most logical choice to state my concern and try to keep my relationship with the employer healthy. If this really is my dream job, then I would fight to keep it that way. To be fair though, my dream job would not have these kinds of problems becuase this is big deal to me.
### Conslusion
Employers make changes all the time. Most will seem minuscule and irrelavant but there are times when speaking up is appropriate. It isn't smo much that the pronouns or the rainbow pin are that bad but the principal that you aren't going to be stepped on. If it is a push for inclusion, they can't exclude or diversify someone in return.
