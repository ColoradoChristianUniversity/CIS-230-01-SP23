# Senario
While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


## Responses
### Option 1: Don't say anything.
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| If I say nothing, there is nothing to worry about. | It is information that I wasn't supposed to see.|
| It keeps the trust of the church leadership. | It leaves the mental burden if I should say something or not. |
|-| The senior pastor should practice what he preaches. |
#### Script
 - No need for a script with a passive response.
#### Scripture
"A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger. " (Prov. 15:1, ESV)
#### First Principle
Some things are better left unsaid. We do not know the situation of the pastor and why he is no tithing.

### Option 2: Ask the pastor why.
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| It gathers more information and could provide conviction enough to change him. | He could be upset and revoke your access to help the church. |
| It is holding the pastor accountable. | It could reveal somthing personal about financial standing. |
| It creates vulnerablility in the church which is important for leadership. | The pastor may shun you for questioning him. |
| It is scripturally appropriate. |-|
#### Script
- Me, "Hey Pastor. While working on that project in the giving records, I noticed you haven't been giving. Is everything okay?"
- Pastor, "I'm sorry but that is none of your concern. I would ask that you refrain from using the church computers and we will remove your access to the records."
- Me, "Due to the circumstance, I am going to bring it up with the leadership council. It is important to hold each other accountable according to Matt. 18. If my brother doesn't repent, I must bring in leaders to oversee the situation."
#### Scripture
â€œIf another believer sins against you, go privately and point out the offense. If the other person listens and confesses it, you have won that person back. But if you are unsuccessful, take one or two others with you and go back again, so that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three witnesses. If the person still refuses to listen, take your case to the church. Then if he or she wonâ€™t accept the churchâ€™s decision, treat that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax collector." (Matt 18:15-17, NLT)
#### First Principle
Following scripture is always a safe way to confront people. God will handle the situation by His word.

### Option 3: Tell members of the church.
#### Pros
| ðŸŸ¢ Pros | ðŸ”´ Cons |
|-|-|
| It exposes the situation.| It is gossip and inappropriate. |
| It is direct and to the point.| It is not the correct way to handle the situation. |
| Action will have to be taken. | The pastor will become upset and embarassed that the church is talking about him. |
#### Script
A, "Did you hear about the senior pastor at that church?"
B, "No! What about him?"
A, "I heard he preaches about giving during every offering and he doesn't give himself."
B, "Wow! I can't believe him. What's to say its worse than that and he is taking the money?"
#### Scripture
"Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear. " (Eph 4:29, ESV)
#### First Principle
Don't talk behind others back. Scripture says its wrong and directs a clear way to appraoch this situation.
### Choice
Option 2. This is the clear approach because there is scripture directly relating to these types of situations. It can be handles peacefully and without telling everyone immediately. Although, I think it something the pastor should have to tell the congregation from his own mouth to keep his position.
### Conclusion
Don't volunteer to help with computers at your church. Too much responsibility. I'm just kidding. As a church, we are all called to hold each other accountable. It is easy to fall off track sometimes and confrontation is not condemnation. Scripture calls us to confront the person directly and to handle it privately. We all sin and fall for temptation. We should work together to prevent it from happening and lift each other up and away from sin.
