# Senario
While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression.
If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Responses
## Option 1: Try to make it known to the coworker that you're available to meet outside of work but in respect to each others boundaries.
### Pros
 - Allowing the coworker to have options and know that someone cares can be a huge help.
 - Building a personal relationship allows the opportunity to evangelize.
 - Building personal relationships can improve the work quality.
### Cons
 - The coworker could respond negatively to being reached out to.
 - Spending time outside of work can be too much pull on youself.
 - If the wrong thing is said, the coworker could get worse and you feel guilty for it.
 - Does not gaurantee the coworker will complete his tasks.
### Script
 - Me "Hey John! I just wanted to let you know that I'm here for you. My door is always open if you would like to come have dinner and talk some time."
 - John "Thank Diego. I'm not sure if I really want to intrude into your home like that though."
 - Me "I understand. If you would rather go out to eat or get coffee, or even just go to lunch together, I'm sure we can find time."
 - John "I could do that. Thanks again for caring."
### Scripture
"These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome 
the world." - John 16:13
### First Principle
The world bring lots of troubles upon us physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. It is important to stand together with Christ at the center.
In Jesus we can have peace with the things that are troubling us and we will have victory.
## Option 2: Suggest that your coworker talk to a professional.
### Pros
 - A professional will know better on how to approach the situation.
 - Your coworker can get medication if needed and talk to someone.
 - There is no direct responsibility if the coworker is unsatisfied by what the professional has to say.
### Cons
 - The coworker can see it as a cop-out to them opening up to you.
 - The coworker could lie about going and get worse.
 - The coworker may not be able to afford it and be embarrassed to say that.
 - Does not gaurantee the coworker will complete his tasks.
### Script
 - Me "John, I'm glad you felt comfortable to open up to me about this. Unfortunately, I don't know how I can help. If you're interested, I could recommend you
 to someone that I talked to before? This counseling firm was great."
 - John "I don't know Diego. I'm not really into the whole therapist thing."
 - Me "I understand. It can be a little awkward at first to talk to someone you don't know. Personally, I think it is easier talking to them instead of trying
 to explain it to the people around me. I'm going to give you there card anyway and if you don't go with them, no harm done."
### Scripture
"Let my soul be at rest again, for the Lord has been good to me." - Psalm 116:7
### First Principle
It is okay to have boundaries and not accept tasks out of your control. It is great to be a conformt to people but it is not an obligation.
## Option 3: Confront the team about how to distribute the coworkers work load to prevent failure.
### Pros
 - The work will get done and there is no fear of losing the large client.
 - You won't have to handle the situation alone.
 - No pressure from yourself if you mess something up.
### Cons
 - The coworkers trust will be broken.
 - It could start gossip in the work place.
 - It does not fix the problem but delays the consequence.
 - The team may not be onm board.
### Script
 - Me "Hey team... I want to talk about John for a moment. He is going through some stuff at the moment and I do not think he will be able to complete his tasks.
 This project is important and we cannott afford to be lacking anywhere."
 - Team "Great. As if there wasn't enough going on with this project, we have to be ready for John to drop at any moment!"
 - Me "I know it isn't ideal but this is a high risk project. We will keep a close eye on him and get him some help once we're done."
 - Team "I just don't see why we have to pick up his slack. He should figure it out like the rest of us."
### Scripture
"I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint." - Jeremiah 31:25
### First Principle
Sometimes people just need help for a short time. It doesn't mean it is a permanent resolution but it can be enough for someone to get back on their feet.
## Conclusion
In the work place, there are going to be personal relationships made. Sometimes a coworker might open up to you with a situation that is unclear on how to handle.
It doesn't mean we always have to be the one to help them with their problem directly but trying to give them options. It is important to keep boundaries in this 
situation though and to stand firm on that.
## Choice
I would go with option one first. As a pastor, it would be my first response to being able to help a coworker and evangelize to them. If someone felt comfortable enough
to open up to me with something so big, they would know I am a Christian and I would do my best to help them. I would make myself available along, pray with
them, and invite the to church. I would always lead them to find comfort in Jesus instead of worldly things.
