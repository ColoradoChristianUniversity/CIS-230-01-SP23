# Senario
While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
## Responses
### Option 1: Tell your employer the soonest it can be completed is in 6 months.
#### Pros
- It doesn't beat around the bush but comes out with the reality of the problem.
- It is not coming with the probleem that it is impossible but that it is possible with this solution.
- Creates a boundary that you will complete your work in the possible parameters.
#### Cons
- Your supervisor will be upset.
- It could cause a write up.
- The project is late.
#### Script
- Me, "I have found a solution to our problem. The soonest it can be done will take longer than expected but will ensure its success."
- Boss, "The time requirement is 2 months. How much longer will this take?"
- Me, "It would take a total of 6 months but is guarunteeds our success. Other solutions do not have a likely success rate and can further delay our problem."
#### Scripture
"Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward." (Heb 10:35, NKJV)
### First Principle
Even though it is uncomfortable to give bad news, it is better to give it straight forard. Beating around the bush will cause conflict later.

### Option 2: Use the software and ask forgiveness on the tardiness.
#### Pros
- It is usually easier to ask for forgiveness than to ask permission.
- It still uses the possible solution to solve the problem.
- It is keeping realistic boundaries in place with the employer.
#### Cons
- The project is late.
- It could cause a correcting action or termination if the employer is not understanding.
- It involves not being completely honest.
#### Script
- Me, "I'm sorry it is not complete yet. This was the best option to go with and it looks like it is going to take a few more months."
- Boss, "It has been two months and it needed to be completed."
- Me, "I understand. The available resources for use left us with no choice to use this option. It is not faster than what it is already doing."
- Boss, "Contact me when it is finished."
#### Scripture
"Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him." (Luke 17:3, NKJV)
### First Principle
Do your best work and be honest with the employer about deadlines. If somehting is not completed on time, ask forgiveness.

### Option 3: Tell the employer from the begining it is not possible.
#### Pros
- Sets the reality of deadlines immediately.
- Gives opportunity to be given proper time needed.
- Asking for more time and being honest could grant some give in tasks.
#### Cons
- Does not provide any positive feedback and can result in reprocussions.
- Sounds like an excuse.
- The government doesn't care.
#### Script
- Me, "Two months is not going to be enough time to complete the problem. Not even close."
- Boss, "This is a time sensative matter and needs to be completed in that time."
- Me, "Well I am going to need about 6 months to finish this.
- Boss, "That is unacceptable. Figure it out."
#### Scripture
"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth." (II Cor 13:8, NKJV)
### First Principle
The truth is the truth. One way or another there is not another reality that this project can be completed before the 6 months.
## Choice
I would choose the first option. Although it is never good to bring problems, I have found it successful to provide a solution with that approach. There is no way the government is not going to happy about the tardiness of the problem but in the given context, that is the only available solution.
## Conclusion
Standing your ground and bringing the truth to the problem is going to set a pattern that things will be delivered when you said they could be. The moment you agree that you can have a task done before you actually complete it, the forgiveness of tardiness will not be as welcoming. Always do your best work and complete it as quickly as possible. Create good work patters so that grace can be given to you when these difficult situations arise.
