# Week 08 Response
## Senario
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
## Responses
### Option 1: Confront the teammate about claiming the work and document the response.
#### Pros
- It is direct and addresses the problem.
- Documentation of the incident will support your cause if you have to esculate the situation.
- Direct confrontation can lead to immediate results.
#### Cons
- People don't like confrontation and might respond poorly.
- The teammate could esculate the situation by trying to say you're stealing his work.
- It could go nowhere.
#### Script
- Me, "Hey teammmate, I'm glad that you are getting a raise in company leadership. I wanted to talk to you about the work I did helping you get there though. Did you tell them I helped you or did you take all the credit? I worked really hard working with you and I deserve some of the credit for this."
- Teammate, "Well they just kind of gave me the credit and we moved on. I didn't find it important to bring you up if they didn't ask."
- Me, "We both know you couldn't have done this without me. Can you bring my work I've done to management's attention? If you don't, I will."
- Teammate, "I'm not sure. I just got this raise and don't want to mess it up. Thanks for your help though."
#### Scripture
"Moreover, if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his faults between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother." (Matt 18:15, NKJV)
#### First Principle
Scripture tells us to confront one another when they wrong us and try to make peace. This give opportunity for forgiveness. Documenting the situation will allow you to approach other for help though if the wrong doer  does not apologize.
### Option 2: Let it go.
#### Pros
- It avoids conflict.
- The teammate will most likely not be able to do the job in leadership and it will be spotted eventually.
- It provides opportunity to gather knowledge in the current position without having to assist the teammate.
#### Cons
- Your teammate gets credit for your work.
- You are missing out on the promotion.
- If the teammate becomes your supervisor, he/she could rely too heavily on you.
#### Script
- Me, "Congradulations teammate. I hope you do well in your new position."
- Teammate, "Thank you for all your help to get me here."
#### Scripture
"But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife." (2 Tim 2:23, NKJV)
#### First Principle
Sometimes there is nothing you can do and it is better to let it go. Even when it frustrates us, it is the way the world works and God will provide opportunities to us.
### Option 3: Go to Management about the situation.
#### Pros
- It is addressing the problem directly.
- It could lead into a promotion in leadership for yourself.
- It is making sure elgible people are in the correct positions.
#### Cons
- Management sould see it as a complaint and an attack at their judgement.
- There is nothing to prove your case.
#### Script
- Me, "Management, I am reaching out to you about Teammate's recent leadership promotion. I have been tutoring Teammate and he has not been understanding the material whatsoever. Seeing why he was promoted, it was the work that I had done while helping Teammate. I do not think Teammate should receive all the credit for the work done."
- Management, "I understand your concern but we agree that Teammate is qualified for the job and there is no evidence for us to see that you worked on this project."
#### Scripture
"But if he will not hear, take with you by the mouth of one or two or three witnesses every word may be established." (Matt 18:16, NKJV)
#### First Principle
Sometimes situations are too big to handle alone. It is better to ask for help through management or equals about the situation.
### Conslusion
Nobody likes to do work and have all the credit taken by someone else. Though we can try to fight for what is right and get the credit we deserve, it has been my experience that this never happens. Management doesn't like to be questioned on their decisions.
### My Choice
Although it is the most passive and doesn't help, Option 2 is my choice. Trust God in all situations and let the conflict go. It is not worsth starting a foolish argument over something that can lead to better opportunities for yourself.
