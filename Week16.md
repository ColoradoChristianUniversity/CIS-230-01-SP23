# Question

You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's technically true, but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you specifically because you have access to details of the public figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking about, as they often attack Christians in public without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency and individual dignity. You also consider your belief in obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, and the right of self-preservation. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

Leave nothing undone that you ought to do."

**ðŸ¤” First principle:**
It is important to not just tell people what they want to hear but make sure and stand for the truth. 

## Conclusion

What an interesting situation this is. Right of the bat I am not a huge fan of the news so that should tell you where I am going with this. I would rather never be associated with the news because who knows what they are saying nowadays.
Being pressed by someone to talk lowly of another would not be a great place to be on especially on the news. I would want to honor the public figure even if I was not a huge fan of him. That is why I would lean more towards not even talking to the news at all.
I think this would allow for the best outcome in this situation.

## My Choice

Out of the options above, I would choose Option 2: Walk away from the interview with the news. I believe that by doing this I would eliminate all bad situations. The only thing people can do after I walk away is assume. They will have no facts or opinions from me.
I think this is best because it does not get anyone involved in a bad situation. For these reasons I believe option 2 is the best option.
