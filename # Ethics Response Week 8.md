### Gabe Lambrecht
#### Programming Foundations 2

Prompt: While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

____Option 1____ : Have a candid conversation with your teammate: Schedule a meeting with your teammate and explain the situation to him/her. Express your concerns and provide specific examples of areas where he/she needs to improve. Ask if he/she has any questions or concerns and offer your support and assistance to help him/her improve.


Pros: 
- Gives you the chance to express personal feelings with the team member about their performance.
- Gives team member the chance to explain what areas they are still struggling with.
- Opens up the opportunity to talk about the upcoming promotion and to offer insight on what needs to be improved before taking it.

Cons: 
- Team member could find the conversation offensive if not delivered correctly.
- Team member could get defensive if they believe their work is satisfactory and I do not. 
- Conversation could lead to me telling management that this team member is not ready for promotion, and could cause team member to hold resentment towards me.

Script: 
Me: Hey Billy, I heard you are up for promotion! If you have a minute, I would like to talk to you about a few things in light of this new promotion.
Billy: Sure thing, Gabe!
Me: While working with you during these past six months, I have noticed that there are some areas that you continue to struggle with and it is crucial that you understand these concepts before you take on more responsibility in this new role. For example, Encapsulation and Polymorphism are some areas of struggle that I strongly encourage you to take another look at. I want you to be successful in your new role that this promotion will provide for you so if you have any questions about this, I can help you if you want.
Billy: Thank you for bringing this to my attention, I know I have had a few troubles along the way, but I wouldn't have been offered this promotion if it was'nt for your guidance. Thank you for the advice, Gabe!



Scripture: Hebrews 13:16: “And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.”

____Option 2____ : Discuss with your manager: Discuss the situation with your manager and explain your concerns. Provide examples of areas where your teammate is struggling and explain that you have been mentoring him/her for 6 months with no improvement. Suggest that the situation may not warrant a raise at this time.

Pros: 
- Gives me the opportunity to express my feelings about my team member and the consistent struggles he has been having.
- Notifies my boss that I have worked with him for a while and he still is not catching on. My own personal teaching style is not the problem.
- Allows management to consider other and possibly better candidates for the promotion who are more deserving.

Cons: 
- If team member finds out that I went behind his back to talk about his performance, it might break the trust between us.
- Team member could find the conversation between me and management offensive if not delivered correctly.
- Team member could get defensive if they believe their work is satisfactory and I do not. 

Script:
Me: Hey Jerry(Manager)! If you have a minute, I would like to talk to you about a few things in light of this new promotion for Billy.
Jerry: Sure thing, Gabe!
Me: While working with Billy during these past six months, I have noticed that there are some areas that he continues to struggle with and it is crucial that he understand these concepts before he takes on more responsibility in this new role. For example, Encapsulation and Polymorphism are some areas of struggle that I strongly encouraged him to take another look at. 
Jerry: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. The promotion we give out to our employees should be reserved for those who perform exceptional work and have a well-developed knowledge of operations here. This information you have given be will be taken into consideration while we choose wether or not Billy will receive a promotion at this time. Thanks, Gabe.

Scripture: Luke 14:11, “For everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled. And he who humbles himself shall be promoted.”

Script: 
Me: Hey Jeff(HR)! If you have a minute, I would like to talk to you about a few things in light of this new promotion for Billy.
Jeff: Sure thing, Gabe!
Me: While working with Billy during these past six months, I have noticed that there are some areas that he continues to struggle with and it is crucial that he understand these concepts before he takes on more responsibility in this new role. For example, Encapsulation and Polymorphism are some areas of struggle that I strongly encouraged him to take another look at. I understand that he is up for promotion, but the work that Billy and I worked on showed me that he does not understand important concepts and I believe that he is not ready for a promotion quite yet.
Jeff: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. It was my understanding that Billy completed the assigned work solely on his own, without assistance. Is this true?
Gabe: No that unfortunately is not true. I would have liked for him to do that assignment solely on his own, however, I was obligated to help him almost entirely through the project.
Jeff: I see, well considering this information you have provided for me. I will re-evaluate my decision on Billy's raise and maybe give you more time to get him more up to speed. We can talk about his raise in another 6 months perhaps?

Scripture: 2 Thessalonians 3:10 “If anyone is not willing to work, neither should he eat.”

____Conclusion____
Ultimately, it's important to approach the situation with professionalism and focus on finding a solution that benefits the company as a whole. It's important to remember that everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and sometimes it takes longer for some people to learn than others.

____My Choice____

Out of the options above, I would most likely choose option 3. I understand that people learn at different speeds and it is important to be patient with someone when they are struggling. However, when a person is struggling in certain areas and they are up for a raise in their position, if that was my situation, I would rather perfect my weak areas before I get thrown into a position where I am severely under prepared. It is also important to understand that in many jobs, there are people who may have been waiting for a raise much longer than six months and they are constantly being underappreciated for their contributions to the company. Giving management information about an employee can give insight on whether or not a raise should be reconsidered to another person.
