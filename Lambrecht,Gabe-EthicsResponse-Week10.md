#### Programming Foundations 2

`Prompt:` While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?



---

____Option 1____ : Inform the team about the issue, but refuse to work on Sunday:

`Pros:` Honesty and openness can help build trust within the team. Setting boundaries around religious beliefs can also help maintain a healthy work-life balance.

`Cons:` The team might be under pressure to get the system up and running as quickly as possible, and your refusal to work on Sunday might delay the process.

`Script:` 
Me: Team, while working on a project tonight, I accidentally introduced a crippling bug that broke the entire system. I had no idea that this would happen and I apologize for this mistake. I am writing to inform you that because I am a Christian and I have a responsibility to my church community on Sundays, I will not be working on the problem tomorrow. I understand that this may upset some of you, but I will do everything in my power on monday to get this resolved. Thank you.

`Scripture:` Exodus 35:2 ESV 
Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.

____Option 2____ : Work on Sunday, despite religious beliefs:


`Pros:` You would be able to fix the issue and ensure the system is up and running as soon as possible. This would prevent any negative consequences of a delayed fix.

`Cons:` You might feel uncomfortable or conflicted about working on Sunday due to your religious beliefs. It might also set a precedent for future situations where your work-life balance could be compromised.

`Script:`
 Me: Team, while working on a project tonight, I accidentally introduced a crippling bug that broke the entire system. I had no idea that this would happen and I apologize for this mistake. I will be working tomorrow(Sunday), to try and resolve this problem as quickly as possible. Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience or problem this may cause you.

`Scripture:` John 5:17 ESV 
But Jesus answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I am working.”

____Option 3____ :  Work on temporary solutions on Saturday night and inform the team about the issue on Monday:


`Pros:` You can buy some time by finding a temporary solution to mitigate the effects of the bug until Monday, which can help prevent further damage to the system. You would also be able to respect your religious beliefs.

`Cons:` Depending on the severity of the bug, delaying the permanent fix might cause further damage to the system. Additionally, your team might feel like you are not taking the issue seriously by delaying the permanent fix.

`Script:` 
Me: Team, while working on a project tonight, I accidentally introduced a crippling bug that broke the entire system. I had no idea that this would happen and I apologize for this mistake. I am writing to inform you that because I am a Christian and I have a responsibility to my church community on Sundays, I will not be working on the problem tomorrow. I understand that this may upset some of you, but I will do everything in my power on monday to get this resolved. I will continue to try and resolve the issue the best I can with the rest of my time tonight and I will continue working towards a solution on Monday.

`Scripture:` Exodus 35:2 ESV 
Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.

____Conclusion____

In any of these scenarios, it's important to communicate effectively with your team and explain your decision-making process. By being transparent about your religious beliefs and setting boundaries, you can help foster a healthy work environment for yourself and others.

____My Choice____

Out of the options above, I would most likely choose option 2. It is very clear in the bible that it is heavily encouraged to not work on Sundays and remember the sabbath. There is a moral obligation to live by what scripture says. However, if I introduced a crippling bug to the system and I took the day off next day after it happens, I believe that would reflect poorly on my work ethic and responsibility to the company. If another team mate did this and I had to cover them and work on my day off while they did'nt, I would be pretty upset with them. Overall, either don't code on saturday nights if you have obligations the next morning, or fix your mistakes as soon as possible even if it means you have to miss a Sunday.
