# Prompt
The root of this site has the ethics write-up of everyone in class. You can go there and you can browse and read anyone's essays. Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. In this week's essay, summarize each with a simple bullet list and pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). Given their choices, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not. Do you want to include a third essay? That's up to you.


# My choice - Week 4:
While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Why this choice?
Of all the ethics assignments so far, this one seems like the most varied in potential courses of action. I'm interested to see what others thought of that I may not have included.


# Aidan Thomas
    Response 1 - Recommend they use the company's mental health program. The idea here is that there should be an employee assistance program (EAP) for the employee to seek guidance from. I am not certain if this is standardized in all workplaces, but it does seem to be a very common workplace asset.
    
    
    Response 2 - Recommend some time off and assistance. The idea for this one is more centered on letting the coworker refocus on what is good as opposed to what is worldly. This seems more tailored to Christians but is not irrelevant because of that.
    
    
    Response 3 - Ask to pitch in. The idea is that this is just a kind thing to do, but could also lead into you showing them the love of God-- although it seems tricky if you have to balance the two loads at the same time.


# Daniel Wolf
    Response 1 - "Tell him to suck it up". The idea is that he is responsible for himself. Aside from pulling Ezra 10:4 out of context (the book of Ezra is an example of what not to do and how to alienate an entire generation), the pros and cons don't seem to accurately reflect reality.
    
    
    Response 2 - Help him out. The idea is that we, as Christians, should be self sacrificing to help others. While the idea is more solid than the last, the listed cons could be elaborated upon a bit more.
    
    
    Response 3 - Replace him. The idea is that the work still needs to get done and the coworker cannot recover in the current environment. It is dependent upon their being enough personnel to make this happen, but the idea is still valid.


# My choice
I personally found to be all three of Aidan Thomas' responses to be doable at the same time. They were all very courteous and none of them were so committing that you could not simultaneously do the other two. There are differences between Aidan's idea of pitching in and Daniel's idea of doing all the work for them that represents a critical difference between viable and unviable.
