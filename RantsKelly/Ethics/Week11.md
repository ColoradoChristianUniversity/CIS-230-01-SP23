# Prompt
While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# response 1 - Reach out directly.
In this response, you attempt to talk with the owner(s) of the code in order to see if they can get you access before 6 months. You begin by submitting a proper application to use the code, and then looking for direct routes to email/call the owners and discuss with them.


Dialogue:

Me: "Hey man, your repository is exactly what I need for my current project. Given my deadline by {this date}, can I possibly get access to your work?"

Them: "That sounds reasonable, we might be able to expedite the process for you."


Pros:

- The owners will probably be very understanding, and will want to make things work for you.

- It's a proactive solution that immediately answers the question of whether or not you will be able to get access to this specific solution before the deadline.


Cons:

- The owners might not be willing to let anyone past the six month authorization, meaning this solution will not work.

- If there is no method to call them, they may be slow in responding to emails and you will be left just waiting until you get a response.

First Value:

I myself have felt the impact of calling employers to get an interview scheduled. Oftentimes people just need to hear from others. The owner will probably be happy that someone wants to use their code, and two months is not an impossible gap for shrinking down the application process. Thus, the core value for this response is communicating with the owners well.


Supporting Verses:

Proverbs 16:23 (ESV) - "The heart of the wise makes his speech judicious and adds persuasiveness to his lips."

This verse talks about the importance of using your words well, and communicating effectively. That's the goal of this response, to swiftly communicate the situation to the owner and explain why they can help you persuasively.


# Response 2 - Ask for an extension
In this response we will assume that you have tried the first response and recieved confirmation that there is no way to obtain permission to use the code within the deadline. Now you plan on asking for- not quite an extension- but to put the project on hold until you can get access to the code.

What this entails is that you will create a patchwork workaround for now and will be able to deliver the final project in top shape once you have the proper code- but for now you will improvise and manpower can be moved to other locations.


Dialogue:

Me: "Well, the solution we found has been confirmed to take six months to get approval from. What I propose is we ask for an extension until then and offer them an alternative that is similar until we can get our hands on the official product."

Supervisor: "I'll see what I can do, but I can't promise you amything."


Pros:

- Keeps us busy and doing something about the problem.

- We might end up finding the missing link and completing the project on our own while working on a workaround.


Cons:

- We might lose the client.

- We might even lose our position for being unable to complete the task.


First Value:

Our primary value is keeping busy and hoping we'll be able to either figure out what we're missing or providing an alternative that is acceptable to the customer.


Supporting Verses:

Proverbs 18:9 (ESV) - "Whoever is slack in his work is a brother to him who destroys."

2 Thessalonians 3:10 (ESV) - "For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat."

These verses are relevant because the response is focused on staying busy as opposed to remaining idle when all seems lost. Just because the first response did not work out is no excuse to give up, so we must keep working.


# Response 3 - Rewrite
We create two teams. Team 1 will study the code, and examine EVERYTHING it does. Team 2 will be in charge of recreating the code. Team 1 will brief team 2 on basically everything it does. Team 2 will never have seen the code, but will know what it does and create their own code that attempts to achieve these goals. (What was the term for this again?)


Dialogue:
N/A

Pros:

- Creates the solution we need.

- Avoids copyright violations.


Cons:

- Unethical (to me).

- Avoids copyright violation BUT toes the line, could cause issues for us or our customer in the future.


First Value:

Succeeding and not letting anything stop us.

Note: This approach feels disengenuine and should not really be done at all, I feel, but especially not after Response #1.


Supporting Verses:

Proverbs 14:23 (ESV) - "In all toil there is profit, but mere talk tends only to poverty.

This verse is meant as a slander against my other two responses as they both focus on communicating with others, while this one is more oriented towards aggressively solving the problem in a slightly less than ethical way.


# Analysis - My Choice
For starters, I would say that simply stealing the code before getting approval is really not a solution, it's just a ticket to huge problems later on. In this scenario we have to keep busy and use our two months well in trying to solve the problem. I would personally go with Response #1, and ask the owner directly for the ability to use it. If they said no, I would then turn around and choose Response #3. You might be asking me, "But you said not to use Response #3 if you try Response #1?" And you'd be right- but that's because Response #1 tries to build a good relationship whereas Response #3 definitely destroys and goodwill there. Overall the importance of completing the project is greater than the value of the good impression you might make on the owner. The client does not matter in this situation, I would be willing to do this no matter who the client was- it's just what the companies do these days. It's what companies will do until copyright laws are further amended to forbid it.
