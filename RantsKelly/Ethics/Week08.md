# Prompt
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he is up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Response 1 - Discreetly Meet With His Supervisor
After praying for wisdom, you feel like you should bring your understanding to his supervisor, hoping to clear the air and avoid putting a burden on your coworker that he cannot handle.


Script:

# Response 2 - Meet With Him & Recommend He Don't Take It.
After praying for wisdom, you feel like you should bring this news to your coworker and give him an honest assessment of his capabilities.


Script:

# Response 3 - Let It Be.
That's right, just let it go. Do nothing. Why? Well, primarily because I need a third answer and praying for this wisdom is something you should be doing in every scenario. So what's the idea behind this one? Well, if he takes that promotion, then he's choosing to let his supervisor believe that he is worthy of responsibility that he cannot handle. You are letting this coworker choose his future path for himself without your interference, and seeing if the last six months of effort was worth your time.


Is it elegant? No. Is it leaving your coworker helpless and on his own? No. He can refuse the raise citing that he isn't worthy of it and knowing that it comes with an increase in responsibility that he most likely cannot perform to the standards of. Will it reflect poorly on you? Maybe, but you aren't concerned with how you look, you're concerned with whether or not your coworker has learned their limitations (if nothing else) over the past six months.
