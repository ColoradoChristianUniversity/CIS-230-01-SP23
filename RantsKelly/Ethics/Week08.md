# Prompt
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he is up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Response 1 - Discreetly Meet With His Supervisor
After praying for wisdom, you feel like you should bring your understanding to his supervisor, hoping to clear the air and avoid putting a burden on your coworker that he cannot handle.


Script:

You: "I hear that X was up for a raise based off of his work, but I don't believe he can handle the responsibility of the position yet. Having seen the code that brought up the question of a raise, I know for certain that half or more of that code is my own work, and I know that he could have produced something like that on his own. I'm not asking for praise for the work that has been done, I'm letting you know that with his current skill level he cannot handle the increased responsibilities that come with the raise."

The hoped for response from the supervisor: "I'll look more thoroughly into what he has given us in the past/ give him an assignment on his own and see if what you say is true.


Pros:

- Keeps the supervisor in the loop about the team member and how they're doing.

- Allows you to break the news that he isn't catching on at all before it becomes a bigger issue.

- More directly beneficial for your coworker's future growth than a pay raise.

- Prevents him from being assigned more work that is even further out of his league.


Cons:

- Your coworker might feel cheated out of something he deserves after being there for six months.

- If you do not communicate your concerns properly, your employer might misconstrue your intentions as selfish and money grubbing.


Core Value:

You want your coworker to succeed, and you know that giving him a pay raise for what he is currently capable of now will lead to him being given tasks he cannot handle. You also believe that this situation has resulted partially because of a failure on your part to keep your supervisor informed about how well he is progressing.


Verses:

Leviticus 5:1 (ESV) - "If anyone sins in that he hears a public adjuration to testify, and though he is a witness, whether he has seen or come to know the matter, yet does not speak, he shall bear his iniquity;"

I think this verse applies well because it talks about the moral responsibility of the individual to provide accurate information that helps a judge come to an appropriate conclusion. This situation is hardly different. Your supervisor is the judge who must make the call, and it would be unethical of you to withhold this information.

# Response 2 - Meet With Him & Recommend He Don't Take It.
After praying for wisdom, you feel like you should bring this news to your coworker and give him an honest assessment of his capabilities.


Script:

You: "Hey man, I heard that you were potentially up for a raise due to the code we've been working on together. I don't think you should accept it, it will lead to harder assignments that are further out of your current range of capabilities. I think you should ask to revisit it once you have a firmer grasp on the content."

Him, hopefully: "I don't think I could handle those assignments as I am now, thanks for looking out for me."


Pros:

- Gives him the opportunity to step up and take more responsibility.

- Might encourage him to work harder.


Cons:

- The response in the script is very optimistic, he might not react as earnestly as I would hope.

- He might choose to take the raise regardless, leading to a worse situation for himself.


Core Value:

In this response, you're thinking pri,arily about your coworker's growth. You are giving him the chance to choose what is best for himself.


Verses:

Luke 12:48 (ESV) - "Everyone to whom much was given, of him much will be required, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand the more."

This verse is part of the basis for me believing that a raise will entail harder work. If the company thinks he is worth more, then they will give him work that only he can do. It is up to him to choose to admit his limits so that they will not require more of him than he is capable.


# Response 3 - Let It Be.
That's right, just let it go. Do nothing. Why? Well, primarily because I need a third answer and praying for this wisdom is something you should be doing in every scenario. So what's the idea behind this one? Well, if he takes that promotion, then he's choosing to let his supervisor believe that he is worthy of responsibility that he cannot handle. You are letting this coworker choose his future path for himself without your interference, and seeing if the last six months of effort was worth your time.


Is it elegant? No. Is it leaving your coworker helpless and on his own? No. He can refuse the raise citing that he isn't worthy of it and knowing that it comes with an increase in responsibility that he most likely cannot perform to the standards of. Will it reflect poorly on you? Maybe, but you aren't concerned with how you look, you're concerned with whether or not your coworker has learned their limitations (if nothing else) over the past six months.


Pros:

- This response contains elements of the 2nd, but allows your coworker to think about it on his own without your interference.

- Less work for you. You've already worked hard to teach him what you know, it's time for him to think for himself.


Cons:

- He might brazenly accept the raise without admitting his shortcomings, leading to an untennable situation for himself.


Core Value:

Independence. He's been with the company for six months, he should know what will happen if they want to start paying him more money. It's his decision to make, so you'll let him choose based off of what he thinks he needs.


Verses:

2 thessalonians 2:10 (ESV) - "For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat."

The implication of choosing this vers is that ultimately it boils down to whether he will choose to change something or will end up being fired later on down the line because he cannot perform his job as expected.


# My Analysis & Choice
In this scenario, I am assuming two things: The first is that your supervisor is not aware that your coworker is not able to handle the work he is already assigned. The second is that a raise implies an increase in responsibility, and will definitely lead to harder work. With this in mind, you feel it is your obligation to help your coworker avoid what he isn't capable of right now. With this in mind, I would choose option 1. In this scenario I have no clue what kind of individual the coworker is, so I can't trust him to recognize his limitations and be willing to admit his inability to handle the increased load to someone who offered him more money. Option #3 is generally out of the question because of similar reasons to #2, but it also feels like an avoidance of responsibility to not admit that the guy you've been teaching hasn't been learning.
