# Prompt
While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1 - Compliance

Complete the assigned work. This will probably look like you simply accepting the assignment with a "Yes sir." You might feel conflicted that others might lose their jobs because of you, but you also know that it's only a matter of time until someone else does it.


Pros:

-Enhanced job security.

-Continues to provide for yourself or a family.


Cons:

-You are directly responsible for hundreds losing their jobs.


Core Principle:

It's going to get done anyways, I might as well make myself look good while I can.


Verses:

2 Thessalionians 3:10 (ESV) - "For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat."


# Response 2 - Refusal

Refuse to do the assigned work. Regardless of whether or not another company's layoffs affects you, it violates your morals to become an axe-man for any company. Just as you work to provide for your kind, they work to provide for theirs- as such you'd probably tell your boss something like "I'm afraid that I can't work at a company that actively works to get others fired."

This response comes with the expectation that you will be fired, or that you will quit if you are not as the company's actions disturb you.


Pros:

-Keeps a clean conscience.

-Puts your Christian values before your love of money.


Cons:

-Will most likely end with you being out of a job.

-If you have a family you will need to find a new way to support them.


Core Principle:

I will honor the Lord above all else, and will trust in him to provide when hard times come.


Verses:

Colossians 3:23 (ESV) - "Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,"

1 Corinthians 10:31 (ESV) - "So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."


# Response 3 - Ask for a transfer

In this response, you'll approach your boss and ask "I don't feel comfortable with the assigned work. I still believe that I can achieve good work at {Business} and would like to continue working here. Can I possibly be placed on a new assignment?" Whether or not your request is allowed, you still attempt to continue working at the company without violating your morals.

You aren't sure if you're ready to quit for what you believe in, but you're hoping that you won't have to figure that out just yet.


Pros:

-You won't have to be the cause of another person's termination, one way or another.

-You might get to continue your employment with a clean mind, while providing for others.


Cons:

-By displaying that you have a conscience, you might mark yourself as too unreliable for future employment, and could be considered for terminations yourself.

-You have to work for a company that actively seeks to fire employees.


Core principle:

I want to work to provide for a family, but if that comes at the cost of doing the right thing then I'll work somewhere else.


Verses:

Ecclesiastes 3:12-13 (ESV) - "I perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live; also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toilâ€”this is God's gift to man."

1 Corinthians 16:14 (ESV) - "Let all that you do be done in love."


# My choice

I would personally go for Option #3, asking for a transfer.

I would hope not to have to be the reason that other employees get laid off, and so if I were in this position I would contemplate my employment. Am I in a position where I can afford to be jobless for a month? Even longer? While I want to believe I would have the backbone to say no to such a request, the reality is that I cannot anticipate what financial situation I would be in when such a situation occurs, which is why I think asking for an assignment transfer is a preferable alternative. It might work, or you might get fired- there's just too little detail to know how well this maneuver would work. What matters is trying.
