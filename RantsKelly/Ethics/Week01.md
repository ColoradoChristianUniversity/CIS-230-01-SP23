Kelly Rants - CIS-230 Ethics Assignment 01 - 01/22/23

# Scenario
While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employer’s second largest customer:
a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and
profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1 - Stand Firm
In this response, you would probably tell your manager something along the lines of this: "It is against my values to support the pornography industry. I cannot work on this assignment in good conscience. While I realize that ultimatums are not professional, it is not in my interests to work in a company that is fueled by the porn industry."


Pros:

-Clear conscience. You can't know where your money comes from and be proud of yourself in this industry. Go somewhere that aligns more closely with your values and honors God.

-Takes away manpower from pornographic industries, no matter how small the change. Potentially can butterfly effect into a smaller trafficing community.

-Can enhance your coworkers' impressions of Christians if handled well.


Cons:

-High risk of losing your job. your family will probably understand, but understanding won't feed your children.

-Might create friction between your supervisor even if you do stay.

-Can negatively imapct your coworkers' impressions of Christians if handled poorly.


Principle:

Respect what you do. Honor the Lord in ALL things. You represent a bigger cause than that paycheck is worth.


Verses:

1 Corinthians 6:18 (ESV) - "Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body."

1 John 2:16 (ESV) - "For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world."

Psalm 119:37 (ESV) - "Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; and give me life in your ways."


# Response 2 - Shift the Work
In this response, you want to keep your job, but don't feel comfortable doing the work. You'll probably tell yourself something like "The work will get done anyways, so why should I lose my job?" With that in mind, you approach your manager and ask them this: "Can I work on something else? This assignment goes against my religious values, but I still respect COMPANY_NAME, and would like to keep working to better our company."


Pros:

-The request seems likely to be granted.

-You can keep representing Christ at your current workplace.

-You can continue to support your family.


Cons:

-You're being paid by a company that promotes the pornography industry. Your work directly assists the trafficing industry.

-You're failing to represent Christ WELL as you merely avoid the issue as opposed to finding an environment that won't ask you to violate your morals for your paycheck.


Principle:

You find a compromise between quitting and folding. You don't think you're some hero from a Christian movie, but you also don't fully trust in God to see you through the storm. You're just a man trying to do what he can to provide for a family, and you happen to think that means doing unpleasant things at times.


Verses:

Corinthians 3:23 (ESV) - "Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,"

2 Thessalonians 3:10 (ESV) - "For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat."
(The idea is that while you compromise your morals, you are avoiding dishonest work while still taking what work you can to support a family)


# Response 3 - Fold
You're in dire straights, rent is coming up, and you don't know how you're going to make it otherwise. (Note that this is not an excuse for failing to rely on God). In this instance, for whatever reason, you are unwilling to jeopardize your job or risk that paycheck. The script is simply "Okay."


Pros:

-Financial stability, "positive" work relationships.


Cons:

-You violate your morals in the name of money (I know, it's easy to say that without a family of my own to support, but it's no less true).

-Your coworkers will know that a Christian is working for a porn site, and their prejudices will deepen. And if they do not know that you are a Christian to begin with, then what makes you think that you are a Christian?

-What will you tell your family you did when they ask what you're working on?


Principle:

You need this job and money to support your family. Porn is a problem for others, but it's okay if YOU aren't the one watching it.


Verses:

1 John 3:8 (ESV) - "Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil."
(The idea is that your are undoing Jesus' good work)

1 Peter 5:8 (ESV) - "Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour."
(The idea is that your lack of caution will cause others to stumble)

# Conclusion
The problem isn't just one of morals. As Christians, we are called to a higher standard. We strive to live a blameless life, which includes abstaining from sexual immorality. Obviously, this means that we must stand against porn of any form. It is a disgusting perversion of God's glorious creation, and not to be tolerated. To this end it is wrong to contribute to the success of the pornography industry.


There is, however, a second consequence to accepting this assignment. The more profitable the pornography industry, the more human trafficing happens. There is a direct correlation between the two, so to support one- especially in terms of profits, is to condone and approve of the other.


Finally, there are many other harmful effects of pornography, and your actions could lead others into these dire consequences. As a Christian, there is no way to follow God and work on this assignment.

# My choice
Let me preface this by saying that I'm young. I'm inexperienced with the harsh reality of having to make tight financials work while supporting a family, and being the individual directly responsible for getting food onto a kid's plate. That being said, I think 'Option #1 - Standing Firm' is the right choice. This is because as a Christian we are called to do good work in the name of the Lord. I want to be proud of who I am and what I do. I want to look God in the eyes and tell him that I got his message that it was time to move along. Then again, I don't know what will happen in my life. Maybe, I'll get there and things will look different, and I'll choose 'Option #2 - Shifting the Work'. All I know is that I'll never choose 'Option #3 - Fold'.
