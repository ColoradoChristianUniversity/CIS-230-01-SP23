# Prompt
While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Response 1 - Make time to be with them
This response is as simple as doing small things like eating lunch with them, going to dinner after work with them, inviting them on a night out, or even letting them stay at your place depending on circumstances. There are too many unknowns about the circumstances to say with confidence that certain actions are more plausible than others- but the heart behind the idea is that you sacrifice your own free time to be with them while working on the project. What do we hope to achieve by doing this? Put in specifical terms, the goal is to make them realize there are people who care about them, that work does not have to be a dreadful experience rather it can be a place to connect with others and work on something great. Are you trying to play the role of a therapist or a mental wellness councelor? No. You're playing the role of a supportive friend who will give what they reasonably can to help someone back on their feet.


Pros:

- Shows them you care for them.

- Deepens connection with coworkers, which will lead to higher workplace happiness for all of you.


Cons:

- Comes at a sacrifice of personal time. If the project goes on for longer than you can handle then your own mental wellness will be impacted as well.

- Not telling anyone else means it's just as likely to go untreated in the long run, and your coworker won't get help from people who know what they're doing.


First Principle:

When a friend is struggling with depression, or just a hard time in general, it is not your job to fix it. You are not a psychologist, you might just make things worse by trying to play feelings doctor. You merely recognize what power you hold as a friend to be a bright spot in their life, and you use that influence to help take their mind off of things and find a small piece of hope wherever you can. Of course, this might look different in different situations. Do you know them really well? If you don't, you might not be as enthusiastic to let them crash at your place for a bit maybe. The general responses vary too widely to specifically state every course of action you could take.

# Response 2 - Tell a higher up about their situation.
So you were told about their depression in confidentiality, but it seems really bad to you- and maybe the end of the project isn't even in sight. You might even fear for your coworker's life, or for the life of someone else. You recognize that you aren't a therapist, you might just make things worse, and that all you know for certain is that this work environment is only worsening the problem. You would probably approach your boss and say something like this:

"Hey ______, have you talked to ______ lately? We were talking the other day and he opened up about some really hard stuff going on in his life right now. They shared this with me in confidence, but I just think they're in a bad place even without all the pressure from work right now. All this weight from work can't be helping the issue, can you personally check in on them?"


Pros:

- The issue is more likely to get the proper required attention as opposed to leaving your coworker in poor working conditions and hoping they'll do okay.


Cons:

- Your coworker might come to resent you because of your actions.

- If you do not know your boss well, they might respond in a way that you did not expect. They might refuse to assist in any specific way, citing the work that coworker does as 'too valuable' or hard to replace.
