# Prompt
While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Response 1 - Make time to be with them
This response is as simple as doing small things like eating lunch with them, going to dinner after work with them, inviting them on a night out, or even letting them stay at your place depending on circumstances. There are too many unknowns about the circumstances to say with confidence that certain actions are more plausible than others- but the heart behind the idea is that you sacrifice your own free time to be with them while working on the project. What do we hope to achieve by doing this? Put in specifical terms, the goal is to make them realize there are people who care about them, that work does not have to be a dreadful experience rather it can be a place to connect with others and work on something great. Are you trying to play the role of a therapist or a mental wellness councelor? No. You're playing the role of a supportive friend who will give what they reasonably can to help someone back on their feet.


Pros:

- Shows them you care for them.

- Deepens connection with coworkers, which will lead to higher workplace happiness for all of you.

- Maintains the confidence that your coworker placed in you by telling you and only you.


Cons:

- Comes at a sacrifice of personal time. If the project goes on for longer than you can handle then your own mental wellness will be impacted as well.

- Not telling anyone else means it's just as likely to go untreated in the long run, and your coworker won't get help from people who know what they're doing.


First Principle:

When a friend is struggling with depression, or just a hard time in general, it is not your job to fix it. You are not a psychologist, you might just make things worse by trying to play feelings doctor. You merely recognize what power you hold as a friend to be a bright spot in their life, and you use that influence to help take their mind off of things and find a small piece of hope wherever you can. Of course, this might look different in different situations. Do you know them really well? If you don't, you might not be as enthusiastic to let them crash at your place for a bit maybe. The general responses vary too widely to specifically state every course of action you could take.


Verses:

Psalm 23:4 (ESV) - "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me."

This supporting verse is relevant because we are called to be like Christ. We all have walked in the valley, and will walk in it many times until we finally rest. It is my hope that this verse would show us what we should emulate in order to help someone else when they're in their own valley. In my own life, when the summit has seemed insurmountably high, and the shadows darker than ever before, it has been a Christlike friend that has walked by my side and shown me the grace of God through their actions that has brought me the hope and strength to keep climbing.


# Response 2 - Tell a higher up about their situation.
So you were told about their depression in confidentiality, but it seems really bad to you- and maybe the end of the project isn't even in sight. You might even fear for your coworker's life, or for the life of someone else. You recognize that you aren't a therapist, you might just make things worse, and that all you know for certain is that this work environment is only worsening the problem. You would probably approach your boss and say something like this:

"Hey ______, have you talked to ______ lately? We were talking the other day and he opened up about some really hard stuff going on in his life right now. They shared this with me in confidence, but I just think they're in a bad place even without all the pressure from work right now. All this weight from work can't be helping the issue, can you personally check in on them?"


Pros:

- The issue is more likely to get the proper required attention as opposed to leaving your coworker in poor working conditions and hoping they'll do okay.


Cons:

- Your coworker might come to resent you because of your actions.

- If you do not know your boss well, they might respond in a way that you did not expect. They might refuse to assist in any specific way, citing the work that coworker does as 'too valuable' or hard to replace.


First Principle:

Your core idea in this response is that you see someone who is in need of help, and you know that you're not enough to fix the problem. Are you capable of being a helpful person? Of course, but you ultimately don't think you'll be the solution to the problem. You believe involving an authority figure will help ease your coworker's burden more meaningfully than in any way you could on your own.


Verses:

Matthew 11:28 (ESV) - "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."

The main idea behind using this verse is that the ideal leader is someone who you can take your burdens to and recieve help from. While only God can truly fill this role, in this response you are approaching your employer hoping that they will embody Christ (believer or not) in their stewardship of their employees.

# Response 3 - Praying together

This response is more generally aimed at coworkers who have faith. It's not a simple "I'll be praying for you" so much as a daily meeting and talk on how both of you are doing, taking prayer requests, and praying right then and there together. It could even look like doing quiet times together each morning to make sure both of you are getting time alone with God. Just thirty minutes each day spent in quiet contemplation and prayer- it changes lives.


Pros:

- You and your coworker are better preparing yourselves to handle the stressful and difficult things in life by reminding yourself of what's important and who's watching over you and taking care of you.

- Long term benefits and a newfound trust in God.


Cons:

- Only works if your coworker believes in God (if not then I guess you just pray for them instead, but much of the personaly benefit is lost)

- Your coworker might feel that the personal time investment of half an hour each day is too much and that they can't lose even that much (been there, felt that, don't be the guy that worries about the urgent instead of the important).


First Principle:

This response is based off of Charles E. Hummel's book, _Tyranny of the Urgent_. The concept is that when you need to prioritize what is important the most in your life, is when the things that are urgent (but not necessarily important) clamor the loudest. As the world's coolest camp counselor, I've personally felt just how impactful proper administration of quiet times and prayer can be towards helping one power through a gruelling day of hard work. Will all of your coworker's problems resolve themselves? No. Will your coworker be better equipped to face the spiritual warfare we encounter in everyday life, and be willing to fight the battles in front of them? Yes.


Verses:

Psalm 9:9 (ESV) - “The Lord is a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.”

Matthew 11:28 (ESV) - "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest."

these verses could easily be fitted into response 1, but they are much more appropriate here as response 3 is focused on finding peace in giving your worries to God. Response 1 is more focused on showing support as opposed to really putting your trust in God.


# Analysis - My choice
So your coworker has shared their personal struggles with you in confidence- and they think it's gonna stay that way. What do you do? Are they a problem to be solved to you? In ym own personal analysis, I recognize I can play a part in being hope for them, and a firm shoulder to lean on in their suffering. And yet, despite everything I can do, I can't take their pain like Jesus- because I'm not him, I'm broken and limited. Because of this, my response largely depends on my coworker's personal faith. If they're willing to share such personal information with me, then I assume I know where they stand on the whole religion debate- and I choose accordingly. If they're religious, I'll go with option 1 and PRIMARILY 3. Spiritual warfare was never meant to be fought alone, and if Satan is allowed to use armies then so are we. But if they aren't religious, I would probably choose option 1 and 2. I know that the methods that have helped me in the past (time alone with God) won't help them as much. I don't see an issue with inviting them to church as well, but newcomers to the church (in my experience) usually make the mistake of trying to debate the finer points of denominations and figuring out where they stand on predestination instead of focusing on the grace of God.

The answer largely depends on their faith, and like with most situations, it calls for discretion and care. I personally think that response 3 is by far the most impactful answer, but I can't be certain what I would do until I'm really there.
