# Prompt
Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is, so to speak, on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?

# Response 1 - Enforcement of Policy
Your institution's policy covers this topic specifically, stating "Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported." Depending on the severity of the case it is up to your discretion, but not wanting to have a poor showing toward as big an issue as plagiarism, you fail the student if the project is a more significant work and it is evident that the student is aware that this is an academic violation.


Pros:

- Working within the unviersity's established guidelines will help you to avoid mistakes you might not realize you are making.

- The student probably won't ever plagiarize again.


Cons:

- The university guidelines do not allow for a proper expression of the grace that is an integral part of your faith.

- You don't want the situation to turn into a battle of reputations, where the student's reputation has to go down in order for yours to go up. That is a deeply flawed model of education.


Core Principle:

As an inexperienced teacher, the university guidelines are built to cover a much wider range of scenarios than you could even imagine. As such, it is best policy to work within the established guidelines than go off course. With this in mind, you fail the student.


Verses:

Jeremiah 23:30 (ESV) - "Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, declares the Lord, who steal my words from one another."

Exodus 20:15 (ESV) - "you shall not steal."

These verses mainly illustrate the immorality of thievery.

# Response 2 - Fail the assignment
In this response you decide to give the student grace, and so you tell them that you will fail this particular assignment, but will be open to them as a resource for future assignments.


Pros:

- A more fair approach (maybe) to redemptive punishment.

- More hands on approach to influencing the student's future growth. Does not simply avoid the problem by kicking them out.
 
 
Cons:

- Can be percieved as a slap on the wrist by some students, and unfair to others who have recieved worse.

- "Con": Does not build a reputation as the draconic new professor, if you're interested in being that person.


Core Principle:

You want to keep a hand involved in the student's future growth, and do not want to set them back so much for such a momentary decision. Despite this, you're not letting them get off free as they fail this particular assingment.


Verse:

James 4:17 (ESV) - "So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin."

This verse illustrates that the student knew what was right and yet failed to act on it.


James 2:13 (ESV) - "For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment."

This verse illustrates that mercy is more effective than judgement (which I agree with)


# Response 3 - Extension of deadline
In this response you decide to give the student a second chance to complete the assignment. You'll probably release an email saying "Not all of you completely understood the assignment so I will extend the assignment deadline to next week because the concept is important" or something like that. You'll personally meet with the student and tell them the issue you found with their program, and tell them that you have given them an opportunity to redo it correctly this time.


Pros:

- Shows Christlike mercy

- Passes the problem back to the student; allows them to solve their own problems.

- More likely to have a lasting impact on a student than either other response.


Cons:

- Students might refuse to do what is right even after being given a shot at redemption.

- Generally only works once before there are bigger issues to address.

- Might create a reputation that you are a professor who is okay with students plagiarising.


Core Principle:
In this response our core principle is to give the student a chance to fix their problem on their own. If we show them they were wrong, and give them a way to do right, they may act on that chance. As Christians we are called to be emrciful (Luke 6:36), and as such we should give them a chance.


Verse:

Ephesians 4:28 (ESV) - "Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need."

This verse emphasizes the joy of rehabilitating someone. In this response we want to rehabilitate the student into being sufficient.

James 2:13 (ESV) - "For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment."

I also included this verse again because I like it and it's relevant.


# My choice
So a student has plagiarised, and you have to decide how to respond. I would personally go with option 3 for a first time offense, and option 1 for a second time offense. In my life I have felt the impact of mercy far harder than that of consequences. Despite this, there has to be a hard line where you will not cover for the student, and will let them fail when they choose to.
