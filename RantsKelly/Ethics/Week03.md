# Prompt
While maintaining a very popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Response 1 - Compliance
In this response your primary value is stopping the horrendous act you have been made aware of. If you can help, you think doing so is worth more than the potential hit to your reputation that you'll take when it's learned that your code moniters whoever uses it. When asked for your cooperation, you'll probably respond with an "Absolutely, I'd like to start collaborating on making the back door as soon as possible."


Pros:

-Stops injustice

-Morally right thing to do


Cons:

-The fact that whoever uses your code is being monitered will drive away many users to different projects, potentially impacting your livelihood.

-Pulls direct control of your code away from yourself.


Verses:

The primary theme of these verses is that they thoroughly establish the immorality of human trafficking, and the Lord's desire for you to fix injustices. The Bibilical support for this position is strong.

Exodus 21:16 (ESV) - "Whoever steals a man and sells him, and anyone found in possession of him, shall be put to death."

Deuteronomy 24:7 (ESV) - "If a man is found stealing one of his brothers of the people of Israel, and if he treats him as a slave or sells him, then that thief shall die. So you shall purge the evil from your midst."

Micah 6:8 (ESV) - "He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?"


# Response 2 - Denial

In this response your primary value is discretion. You believe that if it becomes publicly known that your code is used by law enforcement to collect potential criminals, people will lose their faith in you. Personally motivated by public opinion rather than morals, you are unwilling to sacrifice your reputation for something that might not even yield any results at all. You'll probably justify your actions by saying "The people who would do that and use code are definitely smart enough to cover their tracks. You wouldn't be able to get anything from the backdoor you're proposing."


Pros:

-Maintains confidentiality with your consumers, which they very much approve of.

-Keeps your code in your hands exclusively.


Cons:

-You might be able to save lives if you were willing to help.


Verses:

Scriptural support for this response is weak. Christians are called to save those in trouble, not to sell them out for their own reputation.

Proverbs 13:20 (ESV) - "Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm"

1 Corinthians 15:33 (ESV) - "Do not be deceived: “Bad company ruins good morals.”"


# Response 3 - Do it yourself

In this response, you recognize that it is in your power to stop a crime. Despite this, you don't want to surrender your autonomy/control over your code, as it is one of your greatest personal values. You devise a plan to create the backdoor on your own, only passing along the collected information along to the police as opposed to letting them access it on their own. This will allow you to maintain a higher level of consumer confidence while also keeping control of your own code and stopping crime. You'll probably propose it like this: "I have a vested interest in helping you end the traficking, however I would like to maintain independent control over my own code. To this end I'll create my own system of monitering users and collecting the necessary information. I'm willing to correspond as much as you need in order to get the right information to you."


Pros:

-Tries to stop crime.

-Keeps independent control over your code.


Cons:

-Puts more work on your plate

-You might not be as thorough in your work as someone else.


Verses:

The verses in support of this verse are greatly similar to the first response. The only difference is the manner in which you go about the solution.

Exodus 21:16 (ESV) - "Whoever steals a man and sells him, and anyone found in possession of him, shall be put to death."

Deuteronomy 24:7 (ESV) - "If a man is found stealing one of his brothers of the people of Israel, and if he treats him as a slave or sells him, then that thief shall die. So you shall purge the evil from your midst."

Micah 6:8 (ESV) - "He has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?"


# My Choice
In this scenario you're balancing liberty and online confidentiality with justice and morality. This dillema is more difficult the more you value privacy and freedom.

I would personally go with option #3 if I were capable of handling it on my own and had the time and knowhow to get the job done properly. If I could not fulfill those requirements, then I would go with option #1.
