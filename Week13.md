# Question

While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
# Answer

## Option 1: Confront your Pastor directly

| **ðŸŸ© Pros:** | **ðŸŸ¥ Cons:** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Allows you to keep it confidential if needed | Could be a very awkward conversation |
| Brings attention to your concer with him/her | He/She could not care that you see it | 
|  | Could get you in trouble for not keeping it confidential enough |

**ðŸŽ­ Script:**

 - Me: Hey, I was working on the computers and I saw in the giving records that your name was not there. Is there any concern there with you?
 - Senior Pastor: Oh yeah we do it that way so that my giving is not seen by others.
 - Me: Oh, very interesting. 

**ðŸ“– Scripture:**

> Galatians 6:1-2 (NIV) - "Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted. Carry each otherâ€™s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ."

**ðŸ¤” First principle:**

It is important to keep fellow believers in order with love and wisdom so that you do not get caught up in the same misorders.

## Option 2: Go to the board

| **ðŸŸ© Pros:** | **ðŸŸ¥ Cons:** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Can recieve guidance from others | The board may not hear from you |
| Brings the problem to trustworthy people | The board may know about it | 
| Notifys the board of a possible issue | Could get you in trouble for not keeping the issue confidential |

**ðŸŽ­ Script:**

 - Me: Hello board, as I was chosen to help with the computers of the church I was also given access to the giving records. In this I saw that our Pastor does not give anything. What should I do with this?
 - Board: Thank you for coming to us with this issue but we already know this. We appreciate your concern, but we do it this way so that nobody sees what he gives in order to protect him.
 - Me: Okay, that makes sense, thank you for your time.
 - Board: No problem, thank you for caring.

**ðŸ“– Scripture:**

> Proverbs 11:14 (NIV) - "For lack of guidance a nation falls, but victory is won through many advisers."

**ðŸ¤” First principle:**

It is important to seek wise counsel through many godly people to find the right answer or decision.

## Option 3: Ignore it hoping that it is a mistake

| **ðŸŸ© Pros:** | **ðŸŸ¥ Cons:** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| You do not have to confront anyone | A serious problem may not get fixed |
| Nobody has to know | No attention will be brought to the issue| 
| You do not get in any trouble | It may have been a test | 

**ðŸŽ­ Script:**

- No script due to ignoring the hopefully unproblematic situation

**ðŸ“– Scripture:**

 > Ecclesiastes 10:13 (NLT) - "Fools base their thoughts on foolish assumptions, so their conclusions will be wicked madness;"

**ðŸ¤” First principle:**

It is important to not be a fool and assume things that are not true. 

## Conclusion

What a sticky situation this would be. You are trying to help your church out by being the "techy" guy and working on their computers only to run across a sticky situation. A Senior Pastor should lead by servant example.
One way should be giving. To find out your Pastor is not giving would be a shock. Now what to do with that information is a whole other story. I personally believe fully in full confrontation in a loving way.
I believe that confrontation fixes 90% of problems. Most of the time it is a simple miscommunication that can be fixed with one conversation. Hopefully in this case that is what ends up happening. But what a serious situation this would be.

## My Choice

Out of the options above, I would choose Option 1: Confront your Pastor directly. This option allows for direct communication between you and who the problem is with. Like stated before I believe in confrontatin.
If you were to confront your Pastor in this situation it would keep the information you found on the down low as well as keep the conversation just between the two of you. I also believe and hope it would be a mistake and the problem would be solved with this one conversation.
That is why I believe Option 1 is the best.
