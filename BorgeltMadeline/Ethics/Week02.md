While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
I can only do so much as a consultant 

# Answer

## Option 1 – Talk to customer about consequences of the shift and possibly providing resources for those who will lose their job 
### Pros: 
-	Makes consequences of the client’s decision clear to them
-	Makes consequences clear while also providing a viable option to make the transition easier on employees
-	Letting go of that number of people could possibly cut down on negative press which often results in letting go of that many people

### Cons:
-	The customer could possibly be frustrated with the suggestion as they are paying me to help improve efficiency and not for help with the consequences  

### Script:
Me: Have you considered providing some type of severance package or financial support for the people you are laying-off?

Client: I have, I would like to avoid any negative press, can you give me a couple options?

Me: Of course!

### Bible verse: 
Philippians 2:4 states
"Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of oters."

### First Principle: 
The principle I would be operating out of is perfectly put by the Bible verse explained above, although it would be beneficial for the company’s profit to transition it is very detrimental to the lives of those who will be laid-off. If I can through my consultation encourage the client to provide support resources for those loosing their job I will honoring what the Bible calls us to do – think of others.

## Option 2 – talk to customer about doing in stages so people have time to figure out where they will go
### Pros: 
-	Gives people more time to figure out where to find a job
-	Will not cause such a dramatic uprise of letting 175 go at once 
### Cons:
-	 The client could not be open to a longer timeline.
### Script:
Me: Would be willing to implement this in stages in order to give your employees more time to find a new job?

Client: I am on a really tight timeline due to funding; I don’t know if I could accommodate more time without losing too much money.
### Bible Verse: 
Luke 6:31 states,
"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" is a biblical concept spoken by Jesus in.”

### First principle: 
The principle I would be operating out of again connect to the above Bible verse, if I was in the place of these people getting laid off I would greatly appreciate a heads-up and time to find another job.

## Option 3 – Talk to customer about which project management method (waterfall, iterative, incremental, adaptive) would be most beneficial to the people getting let go as well as for the company as a whole and their new technology venture.  

### Pros:
-	Causes customer to view goal with people at the same time
-	Helps me understand the type of process they are expecting and how my suggestions can better cater to them
### Cons:
-	I do not see any large cons to this approach as it is more of a clarifying question of goals. 
### Script:
Me: *after walking through the different project managing methods* Which one is most appealing for your project, how would the people you are letting go fit in?

### Bible Verse:
Proverbs 15:22 states,
“Without counsel plans fail, but with many advisers they succeed.”

### First Principle:
Once again, the principle I would be operating out of is reflected perfectly by the above verse. This option provides me with knowledge for how to move forward in helping the client as well as looking out for the employees.
