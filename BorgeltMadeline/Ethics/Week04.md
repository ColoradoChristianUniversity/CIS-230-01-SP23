# Scenario:
While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

Since the scenario includes the word “debilitating” I am assuming it is affecting the teammates performance on the project. 
## Option 1: Affirm I will not share with anyone, offer help in whatever he is working on – if the time pressures are that close, then it’s just the final push
### Pros:
-	Shows concern and a level of confidentiality to co-worker who was vulnerable and honest about his condition. 
-	Also shows consciousness of the importance of this project
### Cons:
-	Could pull your attention away from your portion of the project
-	Your credential could be insufficient to accomplish his portion of the project
### Script: 
Me: That is really heavy, I’m sorry you’re carrying that right now, is there any way I can help with your portion of the project?
### Scripture: 
"Carry each other’s burdens and so you will fulfill the law of Christ." Galatians 6:2
### First Principle: 
My first principle is based off of the above scripture, if I can take a little of his workload so he does not have to drop out of the project and loose his job or money it is the least I can do.

## Option 2: Ask what he thinks is the wisest course of action given his mental health and the project’s seriousness
### Pros:
-	Points to course of action 
-	Shows care for employees current state
-	Shows my concern for his well-being
-	Shows my concern for the importance of project 
### Cons:
-	Leaves decision in his hands (could be pro too)
-	Leave course of action in his hands (could be pro too)

### Script: 
Me: What do you think is the best next steps for you right now considering the seriousness of the project?
### Scripture:
Proverbs 16:9
“The heart of man plans his way, but the LORD establishes his steps.”

### First Principle:
My first principle relates to the above Bible verse – I cannot control the decision of my co-worker; I can only offer options and trust God is in control. 

### Option 3: Ask who they trust enough to hand off their portion to focus on their mental health and whether they would take this to our boss 

### Pros:
-	Shows that accomplishing the project is an important priority
-	Exhibits concern for co-workers mental health 
-	Emphasize their actions and need for it 

### Cons:
-	Co-worker could get offended that I am implying they cannot handle it or that someone else could handle it better.

### Script:
Me: Who do you trust enough to hand off the remining part of your project so you have the space to focus on this? Do you feel like you need that space?
### Scripture:
Galatians 6:2 “Carry each other’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.”
### First Principle: My first principle relates back to the Bible verse above; I cannot carry the burden of my co-workers depression but I can offer the suggestion to perhaps let some carry the burden of the project.

## Conclusion 
This is a difficult situation as it is involving someone being emotional and vulnerable in a high-stake corporate situation, I feel like the options you see as person depends on your priorities, relationship, or career.

## My choice 
I would choose option 2 to gauge where he is at and his perspective on the project and his mental health.
