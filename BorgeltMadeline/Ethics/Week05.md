# Scenario:
You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it very clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:

Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own. The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation. For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words, students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.
**Then this**

Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is, so to speak, on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?
## Option 1: Pull student aside and explain that you know they cheated, you will not take it to the school but there will be consequences.
### Pros: 
-	More personal approach
-	Conveys the seriousness of situation 
-	One on one shows more intention 
### Cons:
-	Could be disregarding school's policies

### Script:
Me: I just wanted to talk to you about your last assignment. It matches an online tutorial video exactly, its leading me to believe you copied it. I’m not mad just disappointed especially since my whole lecture was on plagiarism and the consequences. You will get a 0 on this assignment. You know the schools policies, this is a light consequence, if this happens again I will not be as lenient. 
### Scripture:
 “If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. 16 But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that ‘every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.” -Matthew 18:15-16
### First Principle:
My first principle relates to the above Bible verse, I want to address the student directly out of respect but have them know if this happens again I will go to the school.

## Option 2: Talk to class as a whole about knowing someone cheated without naming names and that if happens again then there will be much more severe consequences than just a public warning. 
### Pros:
-	Will call the student out
-	Shock value 
-	Send warning to rest of class
### Cons:
-	Will call the student out
-	Shock value
### Script: 
Me (to class): Okay guys, in the last assignment someone copied some online code and this would be considered plagiarism. We all know the consequences, I will not act this time but you guys need to be aware and cautious as I will not be lenient this next. 
### Scripture:
“As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the rest may stand in fear.” – 1 Timothy 5:20 
### First Principle:
My first principle is based off of the above Bible verse, it’s a direct warning to the student how committed plagiarism and light warning to others. 

## Option 3: Pull student aside and tell them you know they cheated; they will get a 0 on their assignment but have two days to redo and submit the assignment to possibly change the zero. 

### Pros:
-	Is direct
-	Shows weight of actions
-	Gives a chance for redemption 
-	Shows grace 
### Cons:
-	Could be disregarding school policies 
### Script:
“I know your last assignment was not your own work, you will get a 0 on it right now but I am giving you 2 days to redo the assignment and turn in your own work and I will remove the zero and put that grade in. “
### Scripture:
“For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.” James 2:13
### First principle: 
My first principle is rooted in the above Bible verse. Although what the student did is wrong and I believe it’s important to acknowledge that I also believe that mercy and grace should be shown. The severity of the situation will be shown in the 0 and mercy in chance to change that through hard work. 

## Conclusion:
This is a difficult situation as it pulls between the want to give your student grace and understanding while also upholding school and ethical polices. Shaming the student will bring nothing but bad so it must be handled lightly. That is why in each scenario resulted in some type of second chance. 
## My Choice:
My choice would be option 3: Pull student aside and tell them you know they cheated; they will get a 0 on their assignment but have two days to redo and submit the assignment to possibly change the zero. I like that it is more personable and intentional, it leaves less room for bitterness and more room for communication and offers a second chance if the student is willing to put in the work.
