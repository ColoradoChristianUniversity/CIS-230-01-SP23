# I selected the week 5 prompt which proposes a scenario where a student is caught plagiarizing


## Kelly Rance's Week 5 Response:
* Kelly’s option’s to handle situation included: “Enforce policy”, “fail assignment”, “extension of deadline”
* Out of the options Kelly provides I would select to extend the deadline and offer second chance after speaking to the student one on one. 
*	Kelly also choose this option; I agree with him. As he listed in his pros, it “shows Christ-like mercy” and also “more likely to have a lasting impact on a student than either other response.” It shows respect to the student and also respect to the universities rules.

## Julea Chappa's Week 5 Response:
*	Julea’s options include: “Report them to the Dean”, “don't act further than telling them you know and not to do it again”, “give the student a zero and have a talk giving the student a formal warning, but don't report it up”
*	Out of the options Julea provides I would select to “give the student a zero and have a talk giving the student a formal warning, but don't report it up”. I think this option does a good job of demonstrating the consequences of the students’ actions by giving them a zero on the assignment they plagiarized while also showing mercy and not taking it to the school where they would receive harsher consequences. 
* Julea selected option three because it would protect the student from severe trouble, while also enforcing some consequence so that it won’t be an ongoing issue. It also shows respect to the student who did not cheat. I agree with her for as I stated above it is the best option as it demonstrates both mercy and justice while honoring everyone involved.
