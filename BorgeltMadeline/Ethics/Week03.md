# Scenario:

While maintaining a very popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Option 1: Refuse the request on ethical or legal grounds - introducing a back door could violate the privacy rights of users, and could be illegal in some countries 
### Pros:
-	Avoid any legal issues in other countries 
-	Avoid feeling guilty about invading peoples privacy
### Cons:
-	You turning down an opportunity to help those who cannot help themselves, I would have deal with violating conscience in that aspect
-	Risking my reputation 
### Script:
Me: Thank you so much for reaching out but I feel I cannot violate the privacy rights of those using the open source for legal and ethical reasons. Is there any other way I can help?
### Scripture: 
“Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult. On the contrary, repay evil with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing.” 1 Peter 3:9
I had a hard time finding a Bible verse to support this scenario as I do not agree with it.

### First Principle: Based on the above Bible verse I do not want to uproot one evil by contributing to another. 

## Option 2: I could choose to comply with the request and strive to the best of my ability to do respect people’s privacy – maybe try to release a statement of what happened after the issue is dealt with
### Pros:
-	I would be able to help stop child trafficking 
-	I would have authorities backing my actions and protecting but this could also have ethical and legal implications, as well as negative consequences for the trust and reputation of the project.
### Cons:
-	Could loose the trust of those using the open trust 
-	Risking my reputation 

### Script:
Me: Yes, I can help with that. I will do my best to create a back door that is discrete and respects people’s privacy to the best of my ability. What protection do you offer for me doing this as it could cause some back lash?

### Scripture:
“Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it’s in your power to help them.”
Proverbs 3:27

### First Principle:
My first principle is based off of the verse above, its is in my power to help stop an element of human trafficking, I should do it. 


## Option 3: Before making the decision I could seek legal and ethical guidance to determine the best course of action, I would also seek advice from other coders to see what the best options are. 
### Pros:
-	Would he be taking into account the rights of users and my responsibilities are the maintainer 
### Cons:
-	Do not the timeline of the “authorities”
-	Gives trafficking scheme more time to develop 
### Script: 
Me: Could I have a week to consult some people and gather some knowledge on my options?

### Scripture:
“For lack of guidance a nation falls, but victory is won through many advisers.”
Proverbs 11:13

### First Principle:
My first principle is based off the Bible verse above, there is victory in a multitude of counselors. This is a complicated scenario with much risk in both directions, it would be wise to seek different perspectives and wisdom form people I trust. 

## Conclusion:
The dilemma I faced while writing these options, in particular the first option is that I very much disliked the thought of in-action on my part as the maintainer of the open source. I might be unaware of some privacy laws regarding handling issues like this in an open source platform but it seems wrong to me to pass up the opportunity to stop human trafficking. Although it is violating privacy, the lives of people trapped in human trafficking are suffering violations we can only imagination. In this case I have authorities hopefully protecting me legally, personally I would be willing to risk my reputation as well as trust in m y open source to shut down human trafficking. 

## My Choice:
I would choose a combination of option 2 and 3. I would accept the proposition and ask for little time to seek advice and plan how to do this in the most respectful and conscious way possible.
