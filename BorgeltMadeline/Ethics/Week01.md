#  Scenario 1:

While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employerâ€™s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Reponses:

My primary objective for each response would be to not contribute to the growth and profitability of a porn website. This narrowed my options because my priority is not keeping my job.


### Option 1: Reject task, confront boss/manager directly

**Pros:**
- Rejecting the task would remove the moral pressure and I would not have to battle my conscience
- I would not be directly contributing to the growth of porn
- Taking a solid stance could make other people question the project and create awareness 

**Cons:**
- I could lose my job
- It could possibly compromise my future career

**Script:**

Me: Hey, I saw the upcoming project in helping our second largest customer work out some issues. The work itself is not the problem I just cannot do a job that will help grow porn. That said, I cannot accept this project. I hope you understand, I am willing to walk through any of the consequences. 

Not sure how my boss/manager would respond. 

**Scripture:**
"Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but he who makes his ways crooked will be found out." Romans 12:1-2


**First Principle:** Quitting in this scenario is not an option, neither is assisting in the long term growth of porn, somehow use po.



### Option 2: Accept task, use as an opportunity to crash site

**Pros:**
- Less confrontationalroute
-  "Safer"
- Could be a long-term solution for crashing a porn platform 

**Cons:**
- Could lose job if found out
-  A little deceptive 

**Script:** 
Me: Sounds good, I will get to working on it right away.
Boss/manager: Great!

**Scripture:**
"For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be." Romans 8:6-7

**First Principle:**
God has placed me in this situation for a reason maybe I can use it as an advantage.


### Option 3: Quit

**Pros:**
- Might send message to company
- Run from moral conundrum
- Would not have to work for a company that supports porn

**Cons:**
- Jobless
- Dramatic
- Easy way out 

**Script:**
Me: After a lot of thought and consideration I wanted to let you know I will be putting in my two-week notice. I have really enjoyed working here but the project I was assigned is crossing the line. I do not want to, in any way, promote the growth of porn or work for a company that does. I hope you will take a step back as well realize what you are promoting. 

**Scripture:** "Do what is good and run from evil so that you may live!" Amos 5:14-15

**First Principle:**
I do not want to be a part of spreading or assisting evil in anyway.
