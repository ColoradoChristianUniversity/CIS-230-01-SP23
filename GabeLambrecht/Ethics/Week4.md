____Option 1____ : Personally meet with team member and discuss ways to accomplish this task together. Find ways to utalize company reasources and plan a meeting with other team members to find a solution in a timley manner.


Pros: Builds a personal relationship with the team member. Comforts the team member and allows another possible way to accomplish the task at hand. Relieves some of the pressure that the team member is experiencing.


Cons: Finding a solution or reasources may be difficult. Other team members may be unwilling to assist. The reputaion or credibility of this team member may be tarnished if they are seen as not being able to work on a project of this magnitude.


Script: Hey Gabe, I want to talk to you about something. I want to be honest with you and tell you that I am struggling from severe depression. I have not been able to work efficiently on this project and if I am responsible for loosing the companies biggest customer, it will push me over the edge and I dont think I will want to continue living. 
Me: Thank you for feeling comfortable enough and trusting me with this information. Depression is a very serious mental illness and the first step to recovering from it is recognising it and letting somebody know. I am proud of you for taking that fisrt step. Im sure you are feeling very overwhelmed at the moment and it doesnt seem like there are many other options that are available. However, I will start being here with you and allocating my time to help you find a solution to this project and to utalize company reasources. I will reach out to other team members in the company to see if they too are also willing to help us find a solution. We will get through this together one way or another. If you ever feel like you are losing control, please call me so I can help you further.


Scipture: Luke 6:30: “Give to everyone who begs from you, and from one who takes away your goods do not demand them back.

____Option 2____ : Offer to pray over team member that is struggling with depression and give personal life experiences that can help the team member get through this hard time.


Pros: Builds a personal relationship with the team member. Comforts the team member and allows another possible way to accomplish the task at hand. Relieves some of the pressure that the team member is experiencing. Could poetentially give the team member a different outlook on the situation and their own life and decide to approach the project in a new and more efficent way. Poetentially lead the team member to Christ and show them that God cares for the team member unconditionally.


Cons: Team mate may not be willing to participate if they have had a bad experience with Christians in the past. Team member may not care for personal life expeirences that are given. Could make the situation worse if not articulated correctly.

I have not been able to work efficiently on this project and if I am responsible for loosing the companies biggest customer, it will push me over the edge and I dont think I will want to continue living.
Me: Thank you for feeling comfortable enough and trusting me with this information. Depression is a very serious mental illness and the first step to recovering from it is recognising it and letting somebody know. I am proud of you for taking that fisrt step. I too have been in a similar situation in life and I can tell you that there is always another way out. When things seem up or down in life, it is completly normal and many people go through this when they are overwhelmed and under immense stress. If you are okay with this, I would like to pray over you and ask God for healing and guidance. I dont know if you support this, but when I was at my worst, this was one of the only ways I could see a way out.


Scipture: Matthew 7:13-14 “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.

____Option 3____ : Consult with the boss or manager over the department and share that the team member is struggling with depression. Communicate that if the team member feels responsible for loosing the largest costomer of the company that it may push the team member enough to act irrationally. Suggest that this team member either needs more reasources and other team members, or to be moved to another project.


Pros : Notifies the office authority to the situation and gives them the opportunity to assess the situation. Boss is now better able to make a desicion regarding who will be a better fit for this project. Allows boss to allocate more reasources to the team member to accomplish the project. Relieves some of the pressure from the team mate.


Cons : Sharing personal infomation about another employee behind their back after they opened up to you. The team member may not trust you to tell you any more information about them since you told someone else. The boss may think that this team member is not stable to work at this company anyway and may decide to let the employee go for business reasons.

Me: Thank you for feeling comfortable enough and trusting me with this information. Depression is a very serious mental illness and the first step to recovering from it is recognising it and letting somebody know. I am proud of you for taking that fisrt step.
Me: Hey boss, I wanted to bring something to your attention. One of our team members just came and admitted to me that he is suffering from severe depression. In light of the large project that he is assigned to, this deadline is approaching hard and fast and we need to either give him more reasources or take him off the project and move him to a new one. If we dont do this, his life could be in danger.
Boss: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I will reach out to him in a discreet manner and ask him how the project is coming along. I will also offer him a few options to help him further along in this project. If I feel that he his mentally unstable and no longer able to work on this project, I will speak with HR to give him a few extra resources.


Scipture: Proverbs 25:9-10 - “…don't reveal the secret of another, lest he who hears it reproach you, and the evil report about you not pass away.” & “Give to everyone who begs from you, and from one who takes away your goods do not demand them back.

____Conclusion____

If anyone you know or work with shares in confidece that they are stuggling with mental illness, it is already a sign that they are reaching out for help. The bible teaches us that every life is important to the world and we must do everything we can to help our brothers and sisters in Christ continue to live. In this situation, many people can feel the pressure of a huge deadline and responsibility and if they dont satisfy the needs of the project then they will feel responsible for a lot of future problems. This is why it is important to help the people on your team or someone elses team to find reasources not only for the project, but also for their mental problems. Building a relationship with damaged people is also an important step into helping someone get through hardship.

____My Choice____

Out of the options above, I would choose option 1 which would be personally meeting with team member and discussing ways to accomplish the task together and finding ways to utalize company reasources and plan a meeting with other team members to find a solution in a timley manner. When someone is feeling the symptoms of severe depression, it is important that that person knows that there is someone out there that cares for them. I know if I were in this situation with a lot of pressure, I would want someone to help me find a way to figure out a solution. There is no shame in asking for help and if I can be the person that helps someone in need which could ultimatley save their life, I would choose finding a way to help them. However, it is also important that you dont share information about another person with out their permission because that can cause a person with severe mental disabillities not to open up about anything else, therefore making the problem worse.
