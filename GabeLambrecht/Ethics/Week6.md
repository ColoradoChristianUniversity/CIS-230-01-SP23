Prompt: 

This week is different

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The root of this site has the ethics write-up of everyone in class. You can go there and you can browse and read anyone's essays. Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. In this week's essay, summarize each with a simple bullet list and pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). Given their choices, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not. Do you want to include a third essay? That's up to you.

* Option 1 - Hand off the problem to a colleague to be solved by them.

Pros:
    * Relieves me from having to do the work
    * Skips having a conversation about morals and ethics with management
    * The use of my skills can be directed else where.


Cons:
    * Could get into trouble for not doing the assigned work
    * Could affect my career negatively
    
* Option 2 - Confront the higher up who assigned you the work.

Pros:
    * It would provide direct communication between the two it involves.
    * I would be able to voice my concerns about not sticking to my morals.
    * My higher up would now know my morals and not assign me work related to such things.

Cons:   
    * It could affect the work I am give in the future
    * It could ruin my relationship with my higher ups.

* Option 3 - Quit if they do not reassign me.

Pros:
    * I would not have to benefit a porn company.
    * I would keep my personal dignity and stick to my morals.

Cons: 
    * I would lose my reputation in the workplace.
    * I would not be able to use them for a reference for a future job.

My Choice:

Out of the options above, I would most likely choose options #2. The reason why I would choose this is because if I was able to see that our company is contributing to a well-know pornography website, I would like to see if my boss also knows. This will give me the chance to see what the morals of the upper management at my company are. This will inform my decision on whether or not I should continue to work for this company and it also shows that I have underlying morals that I feel uncomfortable breaking. Contributing to an entity that causes millions of unhealthy addictions is something that I do not wish to enable and confronting the upper management with this problem will hopefully make them see that this is ultimately wrong. I agree with the authors because these are some of the only ways a Christian can handle this problem.

Student 2

* Option 1- Talk Directly with Boss. As a Christian, knowing where my beliefs stand and what I agree to support, working with a company that promotes pornography would not sit very well with me. 
One of my options to move forward in such scenario, would be to talk directly to my boss about how I am uncomfortable completing this task, along with similar ones that may come up.


* Pros:
    * This would allow for clear communication with my authorities.
    * Can prevent future tasks similar to these if boss allows.
    * Allows for clarification of your beliefs and priorities.


* Cons:
    * Can create a conflict with boss since this company is their second largest customer.
    * May lose reliability in completing tasks assigned and create a negative impact on boss towards me.
    * May be given less work or told there is nothing that can be done about this.



* Option 2- Talk With a Co-worker. Another option would be to talk with a co-worker about possibly switching tasks.

* Pros:
    * This would remove the possibility of a negative conversation with my boss. 
    * Allows to create some trust and understanding with co-workers. 
    * Use this as an opportunity to share my beliefs with a co-worker.

* Cons:
    * Might lead to more conflict later with similar issues if the main issue is not communicated well.
    * Boss or manager might not allow this change of tasks. 


* Option 3: Finish the Task. Finishing this task might not be the most comfortable situation, but it is an opportunity to learn and demonstrate the love of God.

* Pros
    * Could use this as an opportunity to show the love of God, and let others know that they aren't judged by me.
    * Allows for me to be more reliable in completing the work assigned to me.

* Cons:
    * Finishing the task without expressing concern could lead to future conflict.
    * I would basically be helping the pornography website be more efficient.

My Choice:

Out of the options above, I would most likely choose a combination of option 1 and 2. First, I would talk with my boss and communicate that as a Christian, I am uncomfortable enabling millions of people to use a platform that causes an unhealthy addiction. Depending on how that conversation goes, I would then find another co-worker to see if they would like to trade tasks with me. Although this still helps the pornography site to grow, it will allow me to focus on bettering the kingdom of God in a different way. If my co-worker asks me why I want to switch, I will also explain that I am uncomfortable enabling millions of people to use a platform that causes an unhealthy addiction. This could open up the chance for conversation with other co-workers of why this is wrong and why we are working for a company that has no problem working on an assignment like this. It tests the overall morals and ethics this company has and if other people in the office feel the same way I do, it could change the minds of upper management. I agree with the author because it is important to stand up for you faith, as Paul says in 1 Corinthians 16:13.
Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be courageous; be strong.
