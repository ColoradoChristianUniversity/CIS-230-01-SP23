Prompt: While maintaining a very popular Open-Source project, 
authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. 
What are three possible responses? What do you do?

Note: an open source maintainer is a volunteer who basically owns a repository others contribute to. 
The repository, if popular, will be used in many software programs as either reference or as a library. An open source project is not owned by a company.

____Option 1____ : I am unwilling to introduce back door code that would give authorities access to data 
which could directly affect the security of individuals and their data.

Pros: Maintains user security over their personal data.

Cons: By allowing malicious attackers or the authorities unrestricted access to my repository, it could sacrifice the security and data of the users.
Allowing government to spy on people with out a warrent.

Script: 

Police: We are conducting an investigation towards an online child trafficking scheme and we would like to ask you to introduce back door code into your open-source repository.
This will allow our team to potentially put a stop to online child trafficking and would save many young lives.

Me: This poses a security problem to my users. If I allow a back door into my repository, the chance of a malicious attacker getting infomation on users increases. 
If I give you (the authorities) unrestricted access, this gives you the power to access user data that decreases the level of security that is provided to my users.

Scipture: Luke 12:2-3 Nothing is covered up that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. Therefore whatever you have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in private rooms shall be proclaimed on the housetops.

____Option 2____ : I am unwilling to introduce back door code for you. This gives you the chance to access unrelated personal data which can violate user privacy.

Pros: Maintains user privacy over their personal data.

Cons: Giving malicious attackers or authorities unrestricted access to the repository may result in violating user privacy and gives them access to unrelated data.
Allows government to spy on people without a warrent.

Script:

Police: We are conducting an investigation towards an online child trafficking scheme and we would like to ask you to introduce back door code into your open-source repository.
This will allow our team to potentially put a stop to online child trafficking and would save many young lives.

Me: This poses a privacy problem to my users. If I allow a back door into my repository, the chance of a malicious attacker getting infomation on users increases. 
If I give you (the authorities) unrestricted access, this gives you the power to access user data in a way without a warrent, which will violate the right to privacy within my repository.


Scipture: Proverbs 28:16-26 Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a helpless people. 16 A tyrannical ruler practices extortion, but one who hates ill-gotten gain will enjoy a long reign. 17 Anyone tormented by the guilt of murder will seek refuge in the grave; let no one hold them back.

____Option 3____ : I comply with the authorities and introduce the back door code.


Pros : Helps the authorites poetentially stop child trafficking scheme.

Cons : Allows authorities access to unrelated user data and sacrafices user privacy.

Script: 

Police: We are conducting an investigation towards an online child trafficking scheme and we would like to ask you to introduce back door code into your open-source repository.
This will allow our team to potentially put a stop to online child trafficking and would save many young lives.

Me: Although giving you (the authorities) unrestricted access to user data scrifices security and privacy, stoping child trafficking should be the biggest concern. 
There are innocent lives at stake and I feel morally and ethically obligated to comply.

Scipture: Romans 13 1 Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God.

____Conclusion____

Government authority can be used in helpful ways to stop the many evils that occur in the U.S on a daily basis. The problem with governing authorites is that there needs to be line drawn on how much access to give the government.
Privacy and security among users is sensitive data that if a malicious attacker were to gain entrance to, it could cause the user many threatening problems.
In this case, introducing back door code into a well known repository allows unrestricted access that authorities can use to their benefit, but at the cost of sacrificing security and privacy without a proper warrent.
This could lead investigators to unrelated data on other unrelated people which violates a right to user privacy online. On the other hand, it is hard to debate the ethical and moral obligation that one feels when they are given an opportunity to stop child trafficking.

____My Choice____

Out of the options above, I would most likley choose option 2. Although it is very difficult to refuse an opportunity that will help the authorities stop child trafficking,
the right to privacy is a constitutional right that everyone has. If I allow access to the authorites to my repository, then they now have access to everyones data, unrelated to the case or not. 
By giving the government this much power, it allows them to spy on everyone who uses the repository which sacrifices the integrity of my open source repository and the livleyhood of the users.
There are other ways to combat online child trafficking, such as reporting sketchy activities to the Cyper Tip Line phone number which can lead investegators towards traffickers.
