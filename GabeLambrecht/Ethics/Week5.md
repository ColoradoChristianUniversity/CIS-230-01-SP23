# Ethics Response Week 5

Prompt: 


You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it very clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:


Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own. The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation. For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words, students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.


Then this


Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is, so to speak, on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?

____Option 1____ : Ask the student to stay after class to talk. Without anyone else in the room other than us two, explain that I knew where they got the answer from and that this breaks the University Plagerism rule. Explain that I need to notify the dean of this incident and this will serve as their first warning. Then say that if they are struggling with the class, then set up a meeting outside of the normal schedule and get extra assistance.


Pros: Gives the student a chance to explain what made them want to look up answers and copy them. Shows the student that you are firm with the acedemic dishonesty policy and that this will serve as the first and last warning the student will get before the consequences.


Cons: Student will be sad and will get worried about how else they are going to be able to solve future problems. Reflects poorly on student record. Develops an unhealthy fear to the professor and the course.


Script: Me: Hey Billy, I was looking at your coding for this weeks assignment and it is obvious that your code is not your own. I found the exact same snytax in a youtube tutorial. I understand that this is a difficult class, but it is a form of plagerism when you copy from the internet. 


Billy: Im sorry, I was at a dead end in finding a solution and I did'nt know what else to do.


Me: Lets set up a meeting together so we can get you back on track in understanding the material. I am going to notify the dean of this incident so consider this as your first and last warning.


Scipture: Ephesians 6:14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.

____Option 2____ : Email the student a response about their homework submission. Say that their homework looks "too good" and I am not convinced that it was their original work. Ask them to meet me sometime this week so I can assess and make sure they are on track. Since this is their first warning, I will not notify the dean, but if this becomes a consistent problem, I will then take further steps to enforce acedemic dishonesty consequences.


Pros: Gives the student a chance to explain what made them want to look up answers and copy them. Shows the student that you are firm with the acedemic dishonesty policy but explain that this class is historically difficult and that I was once tempted to surf the web for answers, but it is so much better to come up with your own solution and you learn better doing it on your own.


Cons: Student will be sad and will get worried about how else they are going to be able to solve future problems. Reflects poorly on student record. Develops an unhealthy fear to the professor and the course.


Script: Me: Hey Billy, I was looking at your coding for this weeks assignment and it is obvious that your code is not your own. I found the exact same snytax in a youtube tutorial. I understand that this is a difficult class, but it is a form of plagerism when you copy from the internet. 


Billy: Im sorry, I was at a dead end in finding a solution and I did'nt know what else to do.


Me: Lets set up a meeting together so we can get you back on track in understanding the material. I am not going to notify the dean this time around because understanding whats okay to copy and use from the internet can be unclear. When I was learning, the internet was a great resource to use when there is a seemingly unsolvible problem. Lets set up a meeting this week so we can get you back on track with the material. If this happens again, I will notify the dean of what is happening with your submissions and there will be consequences.


Scipture: Matthew 18:21-22 Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?” 22 Jesus answered, “I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.

____Option 3____ : Ask the student after class to talk. Ask the student that their homework is outstanding and that they have excelled beyond expection of the class. Offer them a tutoring position for the other students and maybe help with my own personal coding problems. Then ask the student if they would be willing to share tips and examples that helped them understand the homework in front of the whole class in the next session. If they have not crumbled under the pressure and guilt of their lie and have not admitted to it by this point, then explain that I know they cheated on the assignment and that I will notify the dean of their acedemic dishonesty and that they had a chance to tell me the truth. 


Pros : Amusing to the professor in the moment. Gives a chance for the student to fess up to their lie and tell the truth. Scares the student to never cheat again.


Cons : Student will leave a terrible course evaluation at the end of the semester. Student will have resentment towards the professor. It is a pretty mean (but funny) thing for the professor to do to a student.


Script: Me: Hey Billy, can I talk to you after class for a moment? I wanted to tell you that you did an amazing job on your homework assignment. I am beyond impressed with your coding skills and you have surpassed all expections that I have had. You are certainly the most sucessful student in the class and I believe you have a future as a Developer for a fourtune 500 company one day. In fact, I have proposition for you. Would you be willing to take on being the class tutor, I need someone who really understands what they are doing and someone who is morally and ethically sound. Would you be interested in that? Also, would you be able to present to the class some tips and tricks to how you came to your solution next class? I think it would be very helpful for another student to show everyone your thought process.


Billy: Ummmmmmm sure I guess haha


Me: Okay great! I knew I could count on you!


Billy: hahaha yeah I got you bro


Me: Awesome thanks again! One more thing before you go. Lets set up a meeting with the dean of the business school to discuss acedemic dishonesty consequences because you just lied directly to my face. Bro...


Scipture: Proverbs 12:22 Lying lips are detestable to the Lord, but faithful people are his delight.

____Conclusion____

There are many things to consider in this ethical question. On one hand, coding problems can seem impossible to solve at some points and it is very easy to look online to find answers. However, taking code snippets from the internet violates copy right of intellectual property laws and it is also a form of plagerism. It is important to understand that most professors are open and willing to help students figure out solutions to problems and it should be noted that this is always an open resource to use when working on assignments. It is also important not to lie to your professors about assignments because more than likely they already know you did'nt do something right in your assignment. So if they confront you, it is better just to tell the truth that you were struggling with the assignment.

____My Choice____

Out of the options above, I would most likley choose option 1. It has been made very clear that using code from the internet is a form of plagerism and the risk of the reward is not worth it. You could end up making the problem worse if you keep stealing code from the internet and it builds bad habbits in a future career. It is not the end of the world if the instructor notifies the dean and it will teach you a lesson not to do it again.
