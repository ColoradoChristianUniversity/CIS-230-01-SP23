Prompt: While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to a project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. 
When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

____Option 1____ : Do whats best for the Consultancy and do what the customer wants.

Pros: 
Benefits the customers company by making it more efficient.
Positive review of our company if executed well and possible promotions for good work.
Customer is possibly increasing company revenue and productivity in the company.

Cons: 175 people will lose their job.

Script: Customer: Hey company, can you implement Machine Learning software that will assist our customers and make the organization more efficent.
With it, I will be able to lay off employees on pay roll. The funds will go elsewhere in the company.

Me: Sure, I will get started on that right away. Machine Leaning is the future! Thank you for choosing our Consultancy to assist you!

Scipture :
Romans 13 1: Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. 
The authorities that exist have been established by God.

A task is given to you by your boss and you should respect his authority, for his authority is given to him by God.

____Option 2____ : Design the Machine Learning software while also creating training modules that go with it. These modules can train the employees that are about to be laid off.

Pros: There is a middle ground between laying off 175 employees and using machine learning. 
Creating training around the software to keep it updated and working properly is very important.
Can save peoples jobs to those who are willing to learn the training.


Cons: Not everyone will be able to learn the new software.
People would have to have an in depth understanding of computers.

Script: Customer: Hey company, can you implement Machine Learning software that will assist our customers and make the organization more efficent.
With it, I will be able to lay off employees on pay roll. The funds will go elsewhere in the company.

Me: I can see how this upgrade to Machine learing would be beneficial to your company.
However, you will need people to regularly update and monitor the software, which can be a good opportunity for some of your 175 employees to learn.
I will include training modules in the software package for some of your employees to learn.

Scripture: Proverbs 18:15 An intelligent heart acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.

____Option 3____ : Deny the customers request.

Pros: 
The stress of knowing that 175 employees would lose their jobs would be gone, therefore saving the careers of the employees.

Cons: 
Boss at the consultancy may terminate or write me up for not doing my job.
Can cause the customer to spread a negative complection of the company, therefore turning away potential customers.


Script: Customer: Hey company, can you implement Machine Learning software that will assist our customers and make the organization more efficent.
With it, I will be able to lay off employees on pay roll. The funds will go elsewhere in the company.

Me: Although Machine Leaning is the future and it makes companies more efficient,
I could be responsible for a multitude of tragities and problems that could result from people losing their jobs.

Customer: Im calling your supervisor!

Scipture: Hebrews 6:10. “God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.”

____Conclusion____

It is important for an employee to perform their job that satisfies the needs of their team and or boss. However, there are times were someone is put into a situation to determine the fate and careers of other people and that desicion is morally and ethically difficult to make. 
In a situation like this, finding a middle ground is the most attractive option to the person who is designing the product. However, it may not be easy to find a solution and a solution may end up costing more than just doing the original work that the customer intended. Thats why, repurposing the employees
would be a good middle ground since it allows some jobs to be kept in the future.

---

____My Choice____

Out of the options above, I would personally choose option 1. There are many other consequences that could happen to me if I refuse to do a service for a customer. I could get fired or written up if I refuse and the customer could make the Consultancy look bad in the public eye which will drive away customers. Although, it would be hard to see 175 employees lose their careers, people today must understand that technological advances are being made every day and we must adjust to it.
