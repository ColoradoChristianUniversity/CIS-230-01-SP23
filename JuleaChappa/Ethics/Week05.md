# Scenario:
Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a
C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is, so to speak, on the wall. But remember, you love this student: 
you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: 
you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?

# Option One: Report Them to the Dean.

## Pros:
* It upholds your committment to the university.
* It is fair to the other students who did not plagerize.
* It gains you trust from the school.

## Cons: 
* The student will get in a lot of immediate trouble.
* Your relationship with the student will be negatively impacted.
* The student won't get a chance to be heard out before getting punished.

## Script:
* **You:** "I have a student who has copied an exact tutorial code for their assignment, I feel it is my obligation to the school and my other students to report this
incident to you for proper disceplenary action.
* **Dean:** "I am sorry to hear about this happening, that student is typically a good student, I will scheldue a meeting with them to address this properly."

## Bible Scripture:
* **James 4:17** _"So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin."_
* This verse supports the need for taking the correct actions and thus doing the right thing, which subjectively could be telling the dean.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on your committment to the rest of the students and to the school itself.

# Option Two: Don't act further than telling them you know and not to do it again.

## Pros:
* It would build trust between you and the student.
* The student will be protected.
* The student may be able to provide an explanation for their actions if something else is going on.

## Cons: 
* You wouldn't be honoring your committment to the school's policy on plagerism.
* If the situation gets out you could get in trouble from the school for not complying with plagerism rules when it comes to students work.
* It wouldn't be fair to the rest of the class who did not cheat. 

## Script:
* **You:**"Hey student, I am aware that you copied this code from a tutorial webpage, I am upset to see you did this, please don't do so in the future." 
* **Student:**"I apologize for doing this, I didn't know how to do the assignment and didn't want to get a bad grade, I won't do it again, thank you."

## Bible Scripture:
* *Phillipians 2:4** _"Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others."_
* This verse supports this option as by doing this you are looking more towards the best interest of the student and not yourself. 

## Principle:
* This option focuses on protecting the student while being sure the student knows that you know they copied and will be upset if they do so again.

# Option Three: Give the student a zero and have a talk giving the student a formal warning, but don't report it up.

## Pros:
* The student will be protected from more severe consequences.
* The student may be able to provide an explanation for their actions if something else is going on.
* The student will be made aware of the severity of their action.
* The student will pay the consequences of their actions, thus it will be fair to the rest of the class.
* You will be protected by taking it serious enough.
* It is still honoring your committment to the school.

## Cons: 
* Your relationship with the student may be negatively changed.
* The student will be negatively affected by this as their overall grade will take a hit.

## Script:
* **You:**  "Hello Student, I can tell you copied this code from an online tutorial, I am upset this happened and will not tolerate this in the future. This time 
you will just recieve a zero on the assignment, but in the future it will be reported to the dean."
* **Student:**  "I apologize for copying I was stressed out and didn't know what to do, it won't happen again, thanks for giving me another chance."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Matthew 7:12** _"So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets."_
* This verse affirms this option as it is showing grace to the student as you would want if it were you, while upholding your committment to the class and school.

## Principle:
* This option is the best of both worlds, protecting the student while taking the offense serious enough thus fufilling your committment to your other students and the school.
# Conclusion:
* I would personally choose option three as I would be protecting the student from severe trouble, while being sure it won't be an ongoing problem.
 It shows respect to the student, but also honors your other students who didn't cheat. It also honors your committment as a professor to the school.
