# Scenario:
While maintaining a very popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response One: Don't Do It.

## Pros:
* It secures credentials of you and the company you working for.
* It prevents the code being used in other unethical schemes.

## Cons: 
* The child trafficking scheme will not be stopped. 

## Script:
* **You:**"I am sorry to inform you I will not be introducing back door code at this time due to the other major risks of doing so, including
other potential unlawful schemes." 
* **Authorities:**"That is unfortunate to hear, I am sure you will regret not saving the lives of 100s of children."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Colossians 3:25** _"For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality."_
* This verse brings comfort in making the best decision for larger scale protection even with the evil of human trafficking in knowing the evildoers will
have to face their evil in front of the Lord one day.

## Principle:
* This option looks towards the overall protection of credentials and the prevention of future schemes and hacking incidents.

# Response Two: Build A Back Door.

## Pros:
* It would help stop a child trafficking scheme, saving many kids.

## Cons: 
* You and your companies data could be breached.
* It opens room for hackers to slip in and do significant damage.
* It opens the door for other potentially unethical schemes. 

## Script:
* **You:**"I would love to help stop this heinous scheme, I will introduce the back door as soon as possible to help aid in the investigation." 
* **Authorities:**"We are glad to hear we will have your corroboration in this investigation we will be waiting for the back door code, please
get it to us as soon as humanly possible to increase our chances of busting the scheme."

## Bible Scripture:
* **James 4:17** _"So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin."_
* This verse pertains to this if after all things considered this option seems to be the obvious right thing to do in accordance to the Bible or the Holy Spirit.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on the protection of the victims or potentials victims of the scheme, and the ability I have to potentially stop the scheme. 

# Response Three: Do not introduce a back door, but ask if you can aid in any other way including investigating using the code yourself.

## Pros:
* You may still be able to help stop the scheme.
* Company and personal data would be protected.
* Hackers/schemers could not use the back door to fulfill their desires.

## Cons: 
* There may not be anything within the authorities permissions you can do besides introducing the back door, therefore the scheme could still go on.

## Script:
* **You:**  "I will not be introducing back door code at this time due to other major risks of doing so, however, I would be happy to potentially corroborate in other ways within my expertise to stop this heinous scheme."
* **Authorities:**  "That is not what we were hoping to hear, however, we are glad to hear you are open to assisting in other ways, and we will be in contact very soon with more details on what assistance within our permissions we could use."

## Bible Scripture:
* **1 Corinthians 16:13** _"Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong."_
* This verse affirms the actions that would be included in this option in being watchful and acting against unfaithful acts while choosing to stand firm by not introducing back door code that could create opportunity for future schemes. 

## Principle:
* This option looks towards meeting in the middle, by offering aid to authorities to stop the scheme while maintaining the security of you and your companies data through denying to introduce the back door.

# Conclusion:
* I would personally choose option three as I would still be offering to help assist in stopping the scheme through alternative methods, while not opening the door to hackers and schemers also acting unethical and potentially hurting a lot of people. I would also be honoring my obligation to the company I work for to protect and secure their data. I would honestly expect their to be no other ethical way for me to assist authorities, but at least I'd be offering if their is a way I can. Authorities may still have some other methods/ideas they could try to stop the scheme. In other words all may not be loss from this decision.
