# Scenario:
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he is up for a raise as company 
leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Option One: Tell Management If Was Both Your Work.

## Pros:
* Management would be aware that it was also your work.
* Management can reconsider the raise.

## Cons: 
* Management may think you are just trying to take credit for work that's not yours.
* The employee may really need the raise financially but won't get it.
* Management would know the work wasn't just theirs, but not that they have been underperforming in general.

## Script:
* **You:** "I was wanting to talk about the work that has put "teammates name" up for a raise. While they did help, it was actually both of our work. I 
wanted to be sure I spoke up and make sure you guys were aware before making any decisions."
* **Management:** "I am sorry we mistakenly thought it was soley their work, we will discuss and revisit our current action plans."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Ephesians 4:25** _"Therefore, laying aside falsehood, speak truth each one of you with his neighbor, for we are members of one another."_
* This verse supports the need for speaking up and telling the truth as in the end it will better you and the teammate as they will be forced
to continue to improve to get a raise, not just mistakenly be handed one. 

## Principle:
* This option focuses on determining management is aware of the mistake, and that you get credit for your work too.

# Option Two: Talk to the Teammate Gently Urging Them to Insert to Management That the Specific Project Was Both Your Work.
## Pros:
* The teammate would appear ethical for standing up and telling the truth.
* It would loop the teammate in on the mistake.
* Management could reconsider the raise situation.
* Management won't think you are lieing if it is coming directly from the teammate.
* It may save hostility bewteen you and the teammate if they speak up as oppose to you going straight to management.

## Cons: 
* The teammate may refuse.
* The teammate will be upset if they end up not getting the raise due to speaking up.
* The teammate may really need the raise financially but won't get one.

## Script:
* **You:** "Hey "teammate's name", I was made aware that management accidentally mistook the work we did as soley yours. I would appreciate if you would be willing
to speak up and ensure management was aware that it was actually a team effort, thank you!" 
* **Teammate:** "I am sorry you didn't get any credit for it, I will let management know that you were a part of this project and helped me too."

## Bible Scripture:
* *Proverbs 12:19** _"Truthful lips will be established forever, But a lying tongue is only for a moment."_
* This verse supports this option as the truth will be told, and the teammate will be the one doing it thus establishing truthful lips sort of speak, thus honoring
God and showing the company they are a truthful person as well.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on allowing the teammate to stand up, making the teammate look ethical, while alerting management of the mistake and the need to reconsider actions.

# Option Three: Talk to Management About The Teammates Performance The Past 6 Monthes and About the Work Being Yours Too.

## Pros:
* Management will be aware of the mistake and can reconsider the raise.
* Management will be aware of the ongoing problems with the teammate.
* The teammate could get additional training from someone else, or a proper decision could be made for the betterment of the company.
* You will get credit for doing part of the work. 

## Cons: 
* Your relationship with the teammate may be negatively effected if they find out about your talk with management.
* Management may think you are saying the things out of hostility for the teammate getting sole credit.
* The teammate may really need the raise financially but won't get one.
* The teammate may be fired which would negatively effect them.

## Script:
* **You:**  "Hey, I wanted to talk about "teammate's name" and the project they are getting recognized for. I actually was an equal contributor in the project, so I
wanted to be sure you were aware of the miscommunication there, but also I wanted to address some problems I have actually been having with "teammate's name" ..."
* **Management:**  "I apologize for mistaking the work as just theirs, we will be sure address that matter, as far as the other problems go let us talk about it and we
will determine the best plan of action going forward, and then will communicate it with you. Thank you for letting us know."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Isaiah 1:17** _"Learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, plead the widow's cause."_
* This verse supports this option as it is doing good and seeking justice to take these actions. It is overall better for the company and even the teammate in the end. It
may be a hard thing to do and could make the teammate angry, but it is overall the right thing to do.

## Principle:
* This option is good as both matters are being addresses in an open and honest lense, and you are in control of what is said and can give input on what you think the
best actions going forward would be. You may be able to save the teammate their job well getting them resources to be properly equipped even. It also allows them to 
have to truly work for a raise, improving their performance, not just being handed one.

# Conclusion:
* I would personally choose option three as though I would not want the teammate to lose their job or for there to be hostility, I would want the correct actions
to be taken, and for the company to be able to grow as a whole. Even if the teammate does lose their job they may find a better suited job that could be more long term for them anyways.
