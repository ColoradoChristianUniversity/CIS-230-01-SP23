# Scenario:
You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's 
technically true, but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you 
specifically because you have access to details of the public figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, 
you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking about, as they often attack Christians in public
without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency and individual dignity. You also consider your belief in 
obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, 
and the right of self-preservation. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Option One: Give the agency the information.


|   ðŸŸ¢Pros      |    ðŸ”´Cons       |
| ---------------| --------------- | 
| The guy may be stopped from attacking more Christians on a wide scale. | You are still contributing to disinformation as it is still stretching the truth. | 
| You will move up in your career. | It will hurt the person a lot.| 
| It isn't "technically" lying.| It isn't respecting authority. |


## Script:
* **You:** "I will corroborate this statement, hope it helps."
* **Agency:** "Thank you for corroborating, we appreciate your support, you will also benefit from this."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Ephesians 5:11** _"Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them."_
* This verse supports this as it is exposing the "darkness" of the individual the statement is about.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on advancing your career, and protecting Christian's from further wide scale attacks.

# Option Two: Refuse to give the agency the information.

|   ðŸŸ¢Pros      |    ðŸ”´Cons       |
| ---------------| --------------- | 
| It would be more morally correct. | Christian's can still be attacked at a wide scale. | 
| It will be more Biblically correct as it is respecting authority. | Your career will not advance based off this situation.| 
| When you do advance in your career it will be more amicable.| | 

## Script:
* **You:** "Hello, I apologize for the inconvenince but I cannot corrobarate this statement at this time. Thank you for your understanding."
* **Agency:** "We are not very happy to hear that, it would benefit you to do so. Do you not agree with this statement?"

## Bible Scripture:
* **Romans 13:1** _"Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist 
are established by God."_
* This verse supports this option as it is submitting to authority, and respecting it, despite personal opinions.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on doing the right thing and being intergrit, it respects authority and takes the high road.

# Option Three: Give the information to an agency more accurately depicting the situation (giving the actual truth not in the strictest sense).


|   ðŸŸ¢Pros      |    ðŸ”´Cons       |
| ---------------| --------------- | 
|Attacks on Christian's would decrease slightly still. | The other agency will feel decieved.| 
|You would be corroborating something that is fully truthful. | You are still not necessarily respecting authority.| 
|It is more respectful, as it would hurt the person less than the orginal agency would.| The person still may be highly negatively impacted.| 
|Your career still may advance.|| 

## Script 1:
* **You:** "Hey, I cannot corroborate at this time as it is a bit of a stretch, thank you though."
* **Orginal Agency:** "We are disappointed you are not willing to help us when you know the truth."

## Script 2:
* **You:** "Hey, I would love to help you guys, send me your honest statement and I can corroborate it should it be accurate."
* **New Agency:** "Thank you, that will really help us in our campaign, we appreciate it."

## Bible Scripture:
* **John 3:20** _"For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed."_
* This verse supports this option as it is again exposing wickedness, but is still being more respectful in the fact that it is the truth being exposed, not
a statement that is just kind of the truth.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on still protecting Christian's and exposing bad deeds of the person, whilst corroborating something that is actually true.

# Conclusion:
* This is a more obvious one for me, as I personally don't like to group my name with things that are largely political. Therefore, I would proubly go the route of 
not corroborating anything (option 2). I don't think the person getting canceled will solve much, and Christian's will still be attacked especially by some of the 
associated party members. I don't think the benefit of my career advancing would be that much of an incentive, especially because being associated
politically may hurt me when bigger opportunities come along, due to the political seperation in the U.S. Additionally, I do want to be in adherance with the Bible
and respect authority despite my opposing beliefs and feelings.
