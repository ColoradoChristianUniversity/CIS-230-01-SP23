# Choosen Scenario: 
While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. 
If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## _**Kelly's Response:**_

# Option 1: Make time to be with them

## Pros:
* Shows care.
* Builds relationship with them.
* Maintains the trust of the coworker as they confided in you.

## Cons:
* Sacrifices some of their time.
* It may enlongate the depression making it so they don't get more help.


# Option 2: Tell a higher up about their situation.

## Pros: 
* The coworker will most likely get the required attention for their condition.

## Cons:
* Your coworker may resent you for breaking confidence.
* Your boss may respond in an undesired way. 


# Option 3: Praying together

## Pros:
* Help them prepare themselves/support themselves in the difficult things they are facing.
* It provides a newfound trust in God.

## Cons:
* Only works if the coworker is a Christ follower.
* The time it takes to do this may be to much out of their day.

## **His choice is option three to pray with the coworker and lift him up helping him rely on the Lord to gain strength and recovery.**

## My Reaction:
I don't personally agree. I think there are some situations where more than prayer needs to be done. Like a hurt knee sometimes you need pain meds, procedures,
and rehabilitation. It is no different with mental health like severe depression. Sometimes people need meds and rehabilitation to get better. That is not to say
they shouldn't lean in and trust in God, but God provides us resources for a reason and they can help solve illnesses like depression. 

## My Choice:
I would choose option two. I would tell a higher up about the situation given these options. Though it is breaking confidence it is a way to provide them with help
to get better. It is a step that could make a significant impact on their situation. Sometimes breaking confidence is necessary and I believe in this situation it is.
You have to look towards what is overall best for the coworker.



## _**Bennett's Response:**_

# Option 1: Refer them to help.

## Pro:
* Professionals can get involved to help.
* It would help the coworker recover and potentially save their life.

## Con:
* The teammate may refuse help.
* The teammate may not be able to contribute with the project.


# Option 2: Personally take time after work to be with that teammate and show them love and support.

## Pro:
* You can grow your relationship with the teammate continuously supporting them over time.
* You can show personal support towards them.
* The coworker could feel loved through your actions.

## Con:
* They may not recieve the needed professional help.
* You may not be able to adequately help them.
* You may be taking on something you shouldn't be.


# Option 3: Go to my boss about the situation and see what they want to do.

## Pro: 
* Your boss is aware and now has the situation on his shoulders.

## Con:
* The teammate may be upset with you and problems between you and them could arise.
* It could lead to losing the company's biggest client if the project comes to a hault.

## **His choice is option number one to refer them to professionals for adequate help.**

## My Reaction:
I agree with Bennett, I think getting professional help for the coworker is important and could change the course of future events.

## My Choice:
I also would choose option one. Depression is extremely serious and in order to keep the coworker safe, getting them professional help would be overall best thing for
them and the overall company.



# Conclusion:
Depression is a serious matter and an illness and should be treated that way. People suffering with it need help and rehabilitation to get better. Though God can be comforting 
and healing, it is important to be sure the coworker is getting the most guranteed help for their safety. It could prevent a castrophe such as loss of life.
