<H2>Week 2 Scenario:<H2/>
<body>While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency.
When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?<body/>

<H2>Response:<H2/>

<body><H4><i>Option 1: 
One option would be to reach out to your boss and discuss the moral implications of going through with the project. This scenario is one that would be easier to 
relate to your boss in the nature of it. It is something a lot of people would feel sympathetic towards, therefore, talking to management about it could result
in them aggreeing to pass up the project. Of course, it could go a different way where they could not agree and want to push forward with it leaving the
options to go through with it, or risk being fired which could be really bad.
<br><br/>
Option 2:
Another option especially if management is set on pushing through with the project could be to request the project is reassigned to a different employ who does
not feel sympathetic towards the situation. This would take the moral obligation of of you, but then the results are going to still be the same hence not
negating any of the effects. I personally feel this option doesn't really change anything, but it could be a valid chooice if nothing else.
<br><br/>
Option 3:
The final option I came up with would be to intentionally slow the process or mess it up so the employees are not being laid off, since it is based on the success of
the project. However, this involves weighing two morally incorrect actions against one another and just picking the lesser of the two evils. Not honoring your 
committment to the company especially in a shady way, is in itself not a morally sound action. This would be making a decision based upon what is worse which I 
suppose is between the action taker and God, but God typically doesn't push for deception. I feel the first option is the most morally sound one. 
<br><br/>
<b>In Psalms 101:7 it says: "No one who practices deceit will dwell in my house; no one who speaks falsely will stand in my presence." Based on this verse, I feel 
the third option wouldn't be what God wants, but the company is also decieving their employees through mass layoffs so the question is still there.<b/><i/><H4/><body/>
