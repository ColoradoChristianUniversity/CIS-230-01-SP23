# Scenario:
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets.
The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under
the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better 
secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it
could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. 
However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


# Option One: Continue developing the tool anyways.


|   ðŸŸ¢Pros      |    ðŸ”´Cons       |
| ---------------| --------------- | 
| It could decrease inaccurate religious content that creates stereotypes. | It would lead to increased secularization. | 
| The government agency would be pleased with you. | It would be taking more of the prideful route than the moral one.| 
| Your tool could become widely used, making your hardword payoff. || 
| Your are honoring your committment to bring the tool to fruition. || 


## Script:
* **You:** "I worked very hard on this tool you have funded the past few years, and am pleased to see it being put to use by a huge agency such as yourselves. 
Here is the completed tool to aid you in your goals."
* **Government Agency:** "Thank you for creating such a valuable tool, we are very satisfied and appreciate your hard work. We hope you feel it paid off."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Romans 13:7** _"Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom
respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed."_
* This verse supports honoring your committment to the agency as they are funding the project, making its completion, the payment that is owed back to them.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on bringing the funded tool to fruition, honoring a committment you made and gaining recognition, thus ignoring the negative implications.

# Option Two: Refuse to continue developing the tool.

|   ðŸŸ¢Pros      |    ðŸ”´Cons       |
| ---------------| --------------- | 
| It would prevent increased secularization. | The agency will not be pleased with you. | 
| It would be sticking to the moral route. | It is dishonoring an obligation. | 
| | There could be legal ramifications. | 

## Script:
* **You:** "Hello, I head this tool will be used to remove all religious content off of public places. I am personally a Christian, and don't agree with increasing
secularization. Due to this, I feel I need to step down from the project, as I don't want to contribute to its'purpose."
* **Government Agency:** "We are very dissapointed by this news. We don't understand why this is such a big deal to you. Any funding to you will seize, and
we will keep the rights to the tool."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Proverbs 11:2** _" â€œWhen pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom."_
* This verse supports this option as it requires you to put away your pride with the success and recognition the tool would bring to you, to instead take
the moral route.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on taking the moral route in not contributing to increased secularization.

# Option Three: Step-down from the project, and instead take the code/knowledge of the tool and keep developing it seperately to provide to positive needs of other organizations. 


|   ðŸŸ¢Pros      |    ðŸ”´Cons       |
| ---------------| --------------- | 
| The tool could be put to good use. | There could be legal ramifications.| 
| It wouldn't contribute to increased secularizaiton. | The government agency would not be pleased with you. | 
|You would still get recognition in other avenues for the tool.| You may not have the funding to continue developing the tool individually.| 
|The tool wouldn't be all for nothing.|It is dishonoring a committment. | 

## Script:
* **You:** "Hey, knowing now what you guys are gonna use this tool for, as a Christian I don't feel comfortable contributing to your intention. Due to this,
I feel I need to step-away from this project. I apologize for the inconveience."
* **Government Agency:** "We are troublesome about this news. Thanks for letting us know, but any funding you recieve will be seized going forward, and your
access to the tool will be taken away."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Proverbs 16:3** _"Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established."_
* This verse supports this option as it is using the tool, your work, for the Lord by helping good-intentioned organizations, instead of helping secularize
the world more.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on still recieving recognition and a positive payoff for the tool, whilst not contributing to increased secularization.

# Conclusion:
* This is a really hard one. I want to say option 3 is what I would choose, since it would create good, and still allow my work to payoff. However, 
I feel there would be legal ramifications and it would be hard to get away with doing this, and it is a bit 
unethical itself. I suppose if option 3 isn't plausible, I would go with option 2 of simply just stepping-down as much as that would suck.
