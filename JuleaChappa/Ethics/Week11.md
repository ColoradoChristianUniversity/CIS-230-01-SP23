# Scenario:
While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, 
you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Option One: Stay up late to fix the bug on your own before Sunday.

## Pros:
* You wouldn't be working Sunday.
* The bug would have a chance of being straightend out in that time.

## Cons: 
* The bug may not be fixed by Sunday.
* It would be a lot of work crunched into a small amount of time. 

## Script:
* **You:** "Hello, there was a large issue last night regarding a crippling bug that broke the entire system, but I stayed up until midnight being sure it
was straightened out."
* **Management:** "I am sorry that occured, I know you don't work Sundays so we aprpeciate you staying up late Saturday night to fix this huge issue."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Leviticus 23:3** _"Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation. 
You shall do no work. It is a Sabbath to the Lord in all your dwelling places."_
* This verse supports the need for maintaining sabbath desite the gravity of the situation, thus the alternative of staying up to complete it would be 
a good decision.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on staying true to not working Sunday, but still results in the bug being resolved.

# Option Two: Talk to management about the bug and advocate given the issue, you will work/meet just this Sunday. 
## Pros:
* Management would be aware of the issue and could help.
* Management would know it is a one time thing due to the nature of the situation.
* The bug would get worked out. 

## Cons: 
* Management still may raise questions about your integrity with not working Sunday being due to religion.
* It is disobeying sabbath.

## Script:
* **You:** "Hello, I know it is a Sunday and I requested not to work Sunday due to sabbath being a big part of my religion, but there is a crippling bug
that broke the whole system. Due to the gravity of this sitation I would be willing this one time to work this out today and meet with other team members who
could help." 
* **Management:** "I am sorry you cannot participate in your religious activites today, but we appreciate you being willing to help solve this huge issue 
this one Sunday."

## Bible Scripture:
* *Luke 6:31** _"And as you wish that others would do to you, do so to them."_
* This verse supports this option as you are helping fix a crippling issue, and if it were my company I would want my employee to do the same for me. 

## Principle:
* This option focuses on honoring your committment to the company by fixing the bug despite it being sabbath since it is a crippling issue.

# Option Three: Tell management about the issue, but insist because you partake in sabbath that someone else will need to fix it or it will have to wait. 

## Pros:
* Management will be aware of the issue and could thus have someone else fix it.
* It is honoring sabbath.
* You are still offering to help work it out Monday instead.

## Cons: 
* The system being down may cause other huge issues for the company.
* Management may be upset with you for not taking responsibility for fixing it (they may think you just want to pawn the task off).
* It may cause hostility between you and whatever other employee ends up having to fix it on the Sunday.

## Script:
* **You:** "Hey, I wanted to let you know there is a huge crippling bug that broke the system, I am happy to fix it Monday, but due to sabbath I don't work Sundays, 
therefore, if it can't wait you may have to have someone else step in. I apologize for the inconveience, but I wanted to be sure to let you know immediately."
* **Management:**  "Okay, thanks for letting us know, this is a huge issue so we will try to have someone else step in to fix it, but you may still 
have to do more work on it Monday or take on a new project due to this."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Colossians 3:23** _"Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men."_
* This verse supports this option as it is directing us to work for the Lord not man, therefore, following sabbath would be more important then fixing the bug for a
human owned company.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on being sure the company is aware and can make a choice towards what to do, but sabbath is still honored.

# Conclusion:
* I would personally choose option two as though I would not want to disobey sabbath, and my own set rules, the bug would be fixed as quickly as possible with others
also being able to work on it. Management would be happy they were made aware and appreciative for you taking responsibility. Plus, it was made known it is a one-time circumstance, and sabbath will continue to be honored the following weeks.
