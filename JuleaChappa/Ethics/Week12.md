# Scenario:
While working for the government, you are asked to solve a seemingly impossible problem in 2 months. You find a third-party software that can do it, 
but procurement takes 6 months at a minimum. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Option One: Ask them to extend their timeline based on the given circumstances.
 
## Pros:
* There would be enough time to solve the problem.
* It is an honest response to the government on the attainability of of their timeframe.

## Cons: 
* They may deny this notion and ask you to work harder.
* There may be negative consequences systematically to the problem not being fixed in 2 monthes.

## Script:
* **You:** "Hello, I know you asked for this problem to be solved in 2 monthes, but unfortunately it is more complex then expected and the only software I
have found that will solve it, will take 6 monthes minimum for procurement. Could we extend the deadline to be sure the problem is solved correctly."
* **Government:** "We appreciate your honesty, we will dicuss this amoungst ourselves and get back to you about what the new plans may be."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Proverbs 10:9** _"Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out."_
* This verse supports this option as it highlights the importance of integrity, and I feel this route is an honest path as it is being forthright and realistic.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on keeping lines of communication open, and determining the least risky route for getting the problem solved efficiently.

# Option Two: Search for other third-party softwares that can do it quicker.
## Pros:
* A quicker software may be found to solve the problem.
* You wouldn't have to readdress government.
* You could be done with the project faster.

## Cons: 
* Other software options may still take more then 2 monthes.
* Other software options may be more of a risk.
* If it doesn't work or no better one is found, government will be upset for you not being open about the dilemma.

## Script:
* **You:** "Hello, I have found a few software options for this project, some of them would take to long to procure, so I found this one that should solve the 
problem in the 2-month range if all goes right." 
* **Government:** "I am glad you found an option that will meet our goals; however, it better work or we are going to have some more severe issues to deal with."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Galations 6:5** _"For each will have to bear his own load."_
* This verse supports this option as you are focusing on bearing your own load in solving the problem in the timeframe given, even if some risk is involved. 
You are doing your best to fufill all work expectations, which is the load put on you.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on really hitting the deadline even if it is a risky maneuver.

# Option Three: Look into increasing pay to the third-party software owners, and increasing employees on the project, to speed up procurement/implementation time.

## Pros:
* The problem may be solved in time.
* This would be a more guranteed way of the problem actually being solved.
* There would be more people, and thus more checks and balances on the operation.

## Cons: 
* Government may have to approve the increased pay and employees on the project.
* The deadline still may be to tight.
* It would be way more expensive of an operation than expected.

## Script:
* **You:** "Hello, due to the short timeframe of this project, the problem will not be guranteed to be solved in 2-monthes unless we are willing to up the pay to 
the third-party software program that will be able to solve it, in order to expedite our case. We will also need to add some more of our personel to the project 
to implement it faster."
* **Government:** "Wow, okay we will have a meeting amoungst ourselves and determine if this is the best plan going forward. We will update you shortly with
what we decide regarding this operation."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Proverbs 12:22** _"The LORD detests lying lips, but he delights in people who are trustworthy."_
* This verse supports this option as it is very trustworthy to think through the best way to fufill expectations as much as possible whilst being open about it. 
It decreases risk, keeps the government in the loop, will solve the problem, and gives the best chance of it being completed in the the timeframe given. 
It shows both hardwork and integrity.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on being sure the problem can be solved as on-time as possible with the least risks, whilst allowing government to be in the know. 

# Conclusion:
* I would personally choose option three, as it gives the best chance of the problem being solved effectively and on-time. Government is also in the know, so they
are aware of the time dillemma, thus is is the best of both worlds and shows the most integrity out of the three options.
