# Scenario:
While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your 
senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Option One: Let it go.


|   ðŸŸ¢Pros      |    ðŸ”´Cons       |
| ---------------| --------------- | 
| They won't think you intentionally looked for his name. | The senior pastor could continue with this behavior. | 
| It involves the least conflict. | No one would be aware that the pastor is being hypocritical. | 


## Script:
* **You:** "I noticed the senior pastor is not giving to the church, but it is in my best interest to not share this information as ultimately it is the pastor's 
choice, and while it is hypocritical there could be a bigger reason why, and I don't want anyone to think I was intentionally searching people's names up."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Romans 2:1** _"Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, 
because you, the judge, practice the very same things."_
* This verse supports not judging the pastor and instead focusing on your own shortcomings as we all have some.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on staying within my own business and job responsibilities, thus not making a big deal out of the situation.

# Option Two: Talk to the pastor about it and see what is going on.

|   ðŸŸ¢Pros      |    ðŸ”´Cons       |
| ---------------| --------------- | 
| This gives the pastor a chance to explain his side. | This may not give any clarity. | 
| You can explain how you accidentally noticed it. | He still may think you noticing was intentional. | 
| It keeps others excluded from the situation. | He may continue with his behavior. | 
| | No one will know the pastor is being hypocritical (if he doesn't have a good reason). | 


## Script:
* **You:** "Hello Pastor, I volunteered to help with some computer issues and was given access to the giving records to fix an issue, and in doing this I 
unintentionally noticed your name wasn't on the giving list. I wanted to ask you about why that may be, do you have something else going on you have needed the money
for?" 
* **Pastor:** "I am a bit uncomfortable you are asking, but I have had some expensive medical issues I have had to give all my spare money to, I want to 
start giving as soon as I get through these unexpected issues. Thanks for coming straight to me about it."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Proverbs 11:13** _"The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them."_
* This verse supports this option as you are being integrit in addressing the situation, and in questioning a key leader of the church on his intergrity when
proof is present. 

## Principle:
* This option focuses on still addressing the situation, but allows the pastor a chance to justify his side.

# Option Three: Tell the Elders or whoever is in charge of the Senior Pastor about it. 


|   ðŸŸ¢Pros      |    ðŸ”´Cons       |
| ---------------| --------------- | 
| The pastor wouldn't get away with it. | This may cause hostility between you and the pastor.| 
| You can avoid direct conflict with the pastor. | The pastor may not have a chance to be heard out. | 
| It would still stay within the church leaders and not the public eye unless necessary. | They may question if you finding this was intentional or not. | 
|| The pastor could be forced to resign which would negatively impact the church. | 

## Script:
* **You:** "Hey, while I was fixing the computers voluntarily, I was given access to the giving records to fix the necessary issue, and 
I accidentally noticed the Senior Pastor is not in the giving records. I figured this may be something you guys would want to be aware of since it 
contradicts what he preaches."
* **Elders:**  "Okay, thanks for letting us know, I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. We will deal with this situation, but for now we ask that you 
keep this between us while we investigate and determine what we are going to do.

## Bible Scripture:
* **Ephesians 5:11** _"Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.."_
* This verse supports this option as this would be exposing the unfruitful works of the pastor.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on being sure the pastor has to take responsibility for his shortcoming.

# Conclusion:
* This is a hard one in making a decision on what to do. I would proubly choose option one or three. I would proubly let it go, as it doesn't feel like it's my business and I don't
want to "point out the speck in his eye, while there is a log" in mine, especially as he may have other things in his life going on. However, on the other hand, if he preaches a lot about giving and thus it bothers me enough, I may feel obligated to tell 
the elders so the pastor is forced to take responsibility. At least with this option, it would be done within the church leaders and not the public. I honestly think it would depend on how I feel
the leaders are going to react, as maybe they don't think it is as big of a deal and instead I will be negatively looked upon.
