<H2>#Scenario (Week 1)<H2/>
<line>
<body> <H5> While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employerâ€™s second largest customer:
a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. 
What are three possible responses? What do you do?<em/><h5/><body>

<H2>#Response<H2/>
<line> 
<H4>Option 1:<H4/> 
<body><H5>The first possible response is to go through with it no questions asked, because it is your job, and morally unsound companies are always a possibiblity
of having to work with. Therefore, to fufill the committment of your job position you have to accept the task and provide the service you are being paid for. Plus it
being the companies second largest customer, means it could really hurt the company if the requests are not fufilled. While I don't support or condone the porn 
industry at all, I also have to honor my committment to the company that I am employed with.<H5/> <body/>

<H4>Option 2:<H4/>
<body><H5>Another option is to talk to your superior and see if a different engineer could be put on the assignment. You can explain to them that you do not feel comfortable in 
this particular instance to resolve these problems and support the porn company. You can explain that while you value your job, respect the company, and don't
want to hurt them, you feel someone else would be better suited in this instance. It may not be recieved by your superior as planned; however, you are showing care 
for the company you are employed by, whilst sticking to your morals as a Christian. A verse that supports this is 2 Peter 1:5 "now for this very reason also, applying
all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence, and in your moral excellence, knowledge." This supports this option as it talks about supplying moral excellence
and diligience to that. In this case you are being diligient in fufilling your committment to the company by still giving them an alternative way to meet their goal,
but you wouldn't be the one actually making the revisions and directly helping the porn site. <H5/><body>

<H4>Option 3:<H4/>
<body><H5>Another option is to simply decline doing the assignment without even suggesting another engineer take it on. This would be more of the approach of not wanting to 
support it as much as even giving advice for a different person to fufill the requests. This would still include a conversation to my superior explaining my point of 
view, hoping they would understand, but it could result in losing my job. This could be an exceptable outcome in terms of I wouldn't be working for a company that
is working with something I strongly morally reject, and instead I can get a job at a better suited company. However, this may not be ideal if I have a lot of bills
to pay and can't afford that transition time between jobs yet. The scenario is circumstancial and I would have to have more details to definitively make a decision. 
The verse Ephesians 5:3: "But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints," supports this  option as it is saying
that immorality/impurity shouldn't even be named amoung us, meaning we shouldn't be supporting it in any way or form like this option suggests.<H5/><body/>
