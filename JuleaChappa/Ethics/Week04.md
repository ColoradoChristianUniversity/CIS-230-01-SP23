# Scenario:
While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. 
If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response One: Bring in a third party coder to help.

## Pros:
* It would help keep the project on track.
* It may not be to much additional money depending on where the third party coder is being hired from (ex. India).
* It would take pressure off the teammate suffering from depression.

## Cons: 
* It is an additional cost.
* It could be difficult for the additional coder to jump right in.

## Script:
* **You:**"Thank you for confiding in me and being honest, this will stay in confidence. I will look into hiring a 3rd party coder to take some pressure off of you
while keeping the project on track. Please let me know what else I can do to help you." 
* **Teammate:**"Thank you for hearing me out and understanding, I appreciate you trying to help me."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Matthew 5:42** _"Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.”_
This verse emphasizes giving to those who ask, and in this case the teammate is confiding in me and asking for help with the project essentially, 
so personally I would want to honor them asking by helping them, while of course keeping the project on track.

## Principle:
* This option provides help and care towards the teammate while honoring obligations to the company and client.

# Response Two: Talk to the client about extending the timeframe.

## Pros:
* It would help alleviate pressure on the teammate.
* It would keep and open line of communication with the client thus building trust.

## Cons: 
* The client may not agree to extend, thus the problem would still be there. 
* The client may be very unhappy (could even lose the client).

## Script:
* **You:**"Hello, we have been working through the project and are making great progress towards completion, however, due to an unexpected and uncontrollable 
circumstance we may need an extra week to complete the project in order to make the finished product as perfected as possible. Is it possible we push
back the completion date by a week? We apologize for the inconvenience and would be happy to provide some complementary additional maintaince on the project in 
the future to make it up to you." 
* **Client:**"We appreciate you keeping us in the loop with these circumstances. While we are disappointed in it not being done when expected we will agree to 
extend the date this time. We appreciate your additional offer and will reach out about it in the future."

## Bible Scripture:
* **John 15:12** _"My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you.”_
This verse pertains to this option as it is showing care to both the teammate and the client thus acting in love towards both and honoring obligations to both.

## Principle:
* This option focuses on making the teammate and client both happy despite the circumstances.

# Response Three: Offer the teammate a temporary medical leave once he completes the project to help motivate him.

## Pros:
* The teammate would feel relieved knowing they will have a break soon to decompress.
* The teammate would have motivation to complete the project still.
* The project would stay on track without additional disturbances like hiring a new member.

## Cons: 
* The employee may be struggling to much even with the medical leave up ahead to complete the project effectively.
* The medical leave would be an additional cost as the teammate would still be paid without additional work being done.

## Script:
* **You:**  "Thanks for condifiding in me, I will keep this confidential. After thinking I feel a good option would be to complete the project then send you on a
temporary medical leave where you would still be paid but can take some time to decompress, seek help, and heal. Let me know how else I can help, thanks for being honest."
* **Teammate:**  "Thanks for hearing me out and recognizing my need. This sounds like a good plan, and will hopefully help me, I will do my best to complete
 my portion of the project effectively. Thanks for allowing this."

## Bible Scripture:
* **Acts 20:25** _"In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: It is more blessed to give than to receive."_
This verse supports this option as we are still helping the teammate who is feeling weak by promising him time to heal while still helping the client and working hard for them. 

## Principle:
* This option helps the project stay on track without additonal steps needing to be done upfront, but still honors the teammate giving him some time to decompress
 and seek professional help after without having to worry about pay.

# Conclusion:
* I would personally choose option 1, though option 3 seems good too, just as it is a more secure option with ensuring the project stays on track and the teammate
has some pressure taken off of them while the teammate heals and works through the depression, hopefully with professional help.
