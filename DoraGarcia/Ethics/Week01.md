# Scenario
While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employer’s second largest customer: 
a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. 
What are three possible responses? What do you do?
# Response
## Option 1: Talk Directly with Boss
As a Christian, knowing where my beliefs stand and what I agree to support, working with a company that promotes pornography would not sit very well with me. 
One of my options to move forward in such scenario, would be to talk directly to my boss about how I am uncomfortable completing this task, along with similar ones that may come up.

### Pros:
* This would allow for clear communication with my authorities.
* Can prevent future tasks similar to these if boss allows.
* Allows for clarification of your beliefs and priorities.
### Cons:
* Can create a conflict with boss since this company is their second largest customer.
* May lose reliability in completing tasks assigned and create a negative impact on boss towards me.
* May be given less work or told there is nothing that can be done about this.

### Conversation:
- Me: Hello, I would like to talk about the task that I have been assigned and express some concern around it. 
- Boss: Hello, go ahead. 
- Me: I understand the weight if this task and how important it is to our company to get the issues resolved. However, I am not comfortable working with this task because of what this website promotes, as it goes against my beliefs. 
I would appreciate if this task was delegated to someone else. 
- Boss: Thank you for bringing this up. I am willing to assign this task to someone else. 
- Me: Thank you. I appreciate your openness to this situation. I will do my best work with my next assigned task. 

### Scripture:
1 Peter 3:15 (NIV) - "But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. 
But do this with gentleness and respect."

### First Principle:
Open and clear communication should be a priority is conflicting situations.

## Option 2: Talk With a Co-worker
Another option would be to talk with a co-worker about possibly switching tasks.

### Pros:
* This would remove the possibility of a negative conversation with my boss. 
* Allows to create some trust and understanding with co-workers. 
* Use this as an opportunity to share my beliefs with a co-worker.

### Cons:
* Might lead to more conflict later with similar issues if the main issue is not communicated well.
* Boss or manager might not allow this change of tasks. 

### Conversation:
- Me: Hey, I was wondering if you would be willing to switch tasks with me. 
- Co-worker: Oh, why would you want to change tasks?
- Me: Well, working with this company makes me uncomfortable. I would prefer to do other things, since this goes against my personal beliefs.
- Co-worker: Okay, sure. If it makes you uncomfortable we can switch, I am okay with doing that. 

### Scripture:
1 Peter 2:12 (NIV) - Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.

### First Principle:
Adressing situations with others can build an understanding of the situation.

## Option 3: Finish the Task 
Finishing this task might not be the most comfortable situation, but it is an opportunity to learn and demonstrate the love of God.

### Pros
* Could use this as an opportunity to show the love of God, and let others know that they aren't judged by me.
* Allows for me to be more reliable in completing the work assigned to me.

### Cons:
* Finishing the task without expressing concern could lead to future conflict.
* I would basically be helping the pornography website be more efficient.

### Conversation: 
- Boss: Hey, I have assigned a new task for you. It is with our second biggest customer, so make sure you do a good job.
- Me: Great! I will do my best work in completing this. 

### Scripture:
Matthew 5: 14-16 (NIV) - “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. 
Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see 
your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.

### First Principle: 
Showing our love to others with actions will let us show Jesus through those actions.

# Conclusion
The dilemma here is that once the problems that this website is having are resolved, they will be able to get more customers and be more efficient in their work. 
By completing this task, I would be basically helping these people promote what they do and participating in their process of getting more people to join them. 
# My Choice
Out of all the options, I would most likely choose the first one and talk directly to my boss about this. I would of course be gentle with the situation and I would hope that
they would understand where I am coming from. Clear communication is key in many places, and I think it would be the best option to move forward in this scenario.
