# Scenario
While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

## Option 1: Simply show support to teammate and say a prayer.
### Pros:
- Teammate will know they are not alone.
- Teammate may gain more confidence in sharing with me.
### Cons:
- Teammate may have been sharing this just for the purpose of sharing and did not want consolation.
- If I don’t share with someone else, the project may be jeopardized.
### Script:
- Me: “I appreciate you having the confidence to tell me this. I know that working on top of the circumstance is very difficult. I am here if you need anything, work-related or not.”
- “Me: “Would you allow me to say a prayer for you?”

### Scripture:
- Romans 12:15 (NIV) - Rejoice with those who rejoice; mourn with those who mourn.
### First Principle: 
-  Sometimes, all people need is to be heard when they share something they are going through.

## Option 2: Talk to them about possibly taking a break from the project to get any necessary help.
### Pros:
- May help teammate be able to focus on doing things that will help their mental state.
- The project may still go on with someone else.
### Cons:
- Teammate may be offended.
- The project could possibly not go on if the teammate is not able to be replaced with someone else.
### Script: 
- Me: “Thank you for trusting me to share this, I understand how hard it could be to be struggling with this and having a huge project on your hands. Would you consider taking a break to focus on getting the care you need?”
- Teammate: “I will think about it. I am not sure it would be a great idea for the company though.”
### Scripture: 
- Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 (NIV) - “Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up.”
### First Principle: 
- People need people. My teammate may do better if they focus on getting help instead of finishing a stressful project.
## Option 3: Let someone on the team know about the situation.

### Pros:
- Teammate could still get help and focus on a smaller project.
- The project would most likely be successful if everyone is on the same page.
### Cons:
- Teammate may be upset and lose confidence in sharing their personal matters with me.
- There may not be someone that could take over his position in the project.
### Script:
- Me: “Hey, I heard from our teammate that they suffer from debilitating depression. Knowing how important this task is to the company, I am not sure if we should proceed with them on the team. They may not be in the best position to make sure this is done well.”
- Co-worker: “Well that is upsetting to know. Thank you for informing me of this. We may have to see how we proceed.”
### Scripture: 
- 1 Corinthians 1:10 (NIV) - “I appeal to you, brothers and sisters,[a] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.”
### First Principle: It might be better if everyone is on the same page and understanding, even if nothing is done about the situation.


# Conclusion
Since my teammate is suffering from debilitating depression, this may lead to problems with him being able to do their work to their best ability. The project we are working on is a really important one since it is working with our largest customer. Therefore it is important that everyone does their best work. Given the situation of our key teammate, this creates a dilemma that could jeopardize the whole project.

# My Choice

My choice in this scenario would be option number two. I think it is important that our project is done correctly, but I also have concerns for my co-worker. I think my teammate would share this because he needs something to be done about it. If he is able to get the necessary help, we would most likely have them in the company for longer and since they are valuable to us, even if we were not able to complete this project, there will be many more that they will be able to participate in and help our company grow.
