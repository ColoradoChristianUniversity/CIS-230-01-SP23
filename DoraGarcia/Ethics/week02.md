# Scenario
While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response

## Option 1: Agree to do the job.
### Pros:
- Allows the job to be completed.
- Customer satisfaction with the completed project.
### Cons:
- Many people will lose their jobs
- I will be allowing those people to lose their jobs.

### Script:
- Boss: Hey Dora, I have a new project for you. We are helping a customer; once they are done, the company will lay off more than 175 employees because of their new software!
- Me: Wow! That is a lot of people! I will get the job done.

### Scripture: 
Ecclesiastes 7:8 (NIV): The end of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is better than pride.

### First Principle: 
Respecting your authorities goes a long way. The work that is completed may work for a greater good.

## Option 2: Talk to the customer about possible options they have after the project is finished.
### Pros:
- This may give the customer more options that they may have yet to think about. 
- It would allow many people to keep their jobs.
### Cons:
- Customer may already be decided on what they want to do.
- Customer may not be willing to listen.

### Script:
- Me: Hi, I want to talk about the project you are working on with us and would like to see if you are open to other options for your employees instead of letting them go?	
- Customer: Our company has thought of some stuff. What did you have in mind?
- Me: Giving options for working from home would save money on building expenses or allowing employees to work part-time until they secure a different position. I have more ideas I can send you if you are willing to read through them.
- Great! I will think through some of these and get back to you.

### Scripture:
Philippians 2:3-4 (NIV) - Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others.

### First Principle: 
God commands us to love our neighbors. Always look to help others in need.

## Option 3: Talk to the boss about having someone else do the task.
### Pros: 
- I would not be a part of a project that allows many people to lose their jobs.
- The project may not go forward.
### Cons: 
- Boss may not agree to let me switch projects. 
- The project may go on with someone else.

### Script: 
- Boss: Hey Dora! I have a very important task for you. We are helping a customer; once we are successful, they will no longer need over 175 people in their company.
- Me: Well, so many people will be losing their jobs. I am not sure I want to contribute to that. Could someone else complete this task?

### Scripture:
Proverbs 31:8-9 (NIV) - Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute.

### First Principle: 
Sometimes helping others will bring risks to your own interests. 

# Conclusion:
The problem in this scenario is that by helping out this one customer, we would be contributing to the loss of jobs for many people that may have families they must provide for. Although technology is growing and advancing, we should not allow it to eliminate peopleâ€™s jobs. 
# My Choice: 
My first choice would be to talk to the customer about ways to help those 175 and more people at risk of losing their jobs. This does not guarantee a preferred outcome, but it has better chances than the other two options, which will most likely end in the loss of jobs for those people.
