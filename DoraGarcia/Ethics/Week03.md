# Conclusion
The authorities are asking of me to do something that may be considered unethical. It does not necessarily mean that their project is a bad idea, since they are using it for a good cause. They will be able to stop an online child trafficking scheme if I provide what they are requesting.

# My Choice
My first choice would be to talk to my manager as this would allow for clarification on the project. If there was anything that my manager did not approve of, or if he did not want to go forward with the project, then that would be the end of it. However, talking to my manager would also allow me to have a different perspective and give me more options on how to go about this project.
