### Script: 
 - Me: "Hi everyone, I wanted to bring something to your attention that I recently discovered. While working on some records, I noticed that our senior pastor does not give anything to the church.

### Script: 
- Me: ‚ÄúHi, Senior Pastor. While working on some computer records this weekend, I noticed that there are no records for you. I wanted to talk about this because I know that giving is an important aspect of our faith. I understand that everyone's financial situation is different, but I wanted to encourage you to prayerfully consider giving to our church. Is there anything I can do to help or support you in this area?"

### First principle: 

It may be best to have a conversation to encourage honesty and trust in the situation.


## Conclusion
In this scenario, the senior pastor is discovered to not be giving to the church. The Bible talks about giving, and many churches are open about this, and some even have the pastor speak about it. The pastor sets a huge example for the church, so this could cause conflicts with church members if this information spreads without a clear understanding. 

## My Choice

In this scenario, I would choose to pray about the situation first. I would feel more prepared and at peace after talking about it with God and potentially receiving guidance and clarity on what to do in this situation. I would not feel equipped to talk about it directly to the pastor if I did not already have a close relationship with him. Talking to the leadership team would have to be after I have processed the whole situation and prayed about it.
