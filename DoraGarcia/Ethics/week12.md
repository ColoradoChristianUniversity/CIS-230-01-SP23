# Scenario
While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your preferred pronouns in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Answer

## Option 1: Ignore the Email

### Pros:
 - Saves me the uncomfortable reading of an email. 
 - Allows me to follow my beliefs.
 
### Cons: 
 - This may be required.
 - Might get in trouble if this is strictly required.
 
### Script: 
 - Me: “I saw an email from HR earlier, but I did not agree with what they asked me to do, so I am just going to ignore it for now.”

### Scripture: 

> Daniel 3:17 NIV -  “If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us from Your Majesty’s hand.”

- The men chose to obey God rather than worship a fake god.

### First principle: 

Obeying God’s law is more important than human law that goes against it.


## Option 2: Reply to the email and ask if it is necessary or strictly required.

### Pros: 
 - Allows me to know if this is a potential risk of losing my job if I disagree with the email.
 - Allows clarity on the situation.
 - Allows me to explain what my beliefs are.

### Cons: 
 - I may discover if this is bad news for me.
 - This could be an awkward or uncomfortable conversation on both sides.
 
### Script: 
 - Me: “Hi, I am wondering if what was mentioned in the email is required of us. I am not sure that I agree with both of the things you are asking of us. If you need more explanation, I am happy to provide more information. Thank you.”
 - 

### Scripture: 

> Daniel 1:8 (NIV) -  “But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine, and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way.”

### First principle: 

- Sometimes it just takes the courage to ask for something in order to stay true to your beliefs.

## Option 3: Ask other Christian friends or leaders for advice.

  Pros: 

 - I would get a different perspective on the situation.
 - May be able to make a clearer decision.
 - I would not be alone in making this decision.

### Cons: 

 - The people I ask may not know how to help me.
 - They may not give the best advice.
 - I may still be troubled after hearing other perspectives.

### Script: 
- Me: “Hey. So they are asking me to put my pronouns on my email signature and bring a rainbow pin to work. I know this isn’t what we stand for as Christians, so I don’t want to promote it. However, I am unsure what to do if this can potentially risk my job position or turn into something bigger. Can you give me some advice? What are your thoughts on this?”
- Friend: “This is a difficult topic to deal with. Let’s get lunch and talk about it.”

### Scripture: 

> Proverbs 12:15 (NIV) - “The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice.”


### First principle: 

- It is always best to listen to others in our community for advice and words of wisdom.

## Conclusion
The issue here is that the job asks us to go against God’s law and promote sinful behavior. They are asking us to wear rainbow pins to “celebrate” this, but in reality, we, as Christians, know this should not be celebrated.


## My Choice

My choice would be to talk to other Christian friends and leaders I can confide in for advice. In today’s society, it can be hard to make clear decisions when the noises from the world are really loud. I think I would make the best choice once I have talked to others who can give me biblical advice and set a clear perspective on the situation.
