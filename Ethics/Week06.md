This week is different

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The root of this site has the ethics write-up of everyone in class. You can go there and you can browse and read anyone's essays. Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. In this week's essay, summarize each with a simple bullet list and pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). Given their choices, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not. Do you want to include a third essay? That's up to you.

# Week 4 Peer Response
While working a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Aidan
* Suggest teammate to make use of company resources
* Recommend teammate take time off
* Offer to take up a portion of their job

## Madeline
* Offer to help but keep his issues a secret 
* Ask him what he thinks is best to do
* Ask who they would want to talk to

# My Choice out of these choices.
I think Aidan's option 3 is the best course of action as it shows that you are willing to be a trustworthy coworker and friend whilst helping with the project. I think company resources for mental health are nice to have, but if you are to pushing someone who is already struggling, there is a chance they might take poorly to it. In the same way, a lot of people with debiltating depression don't exactly know what they want, and it can be hard to ask them if they want time off, or what they think would be helpful.
