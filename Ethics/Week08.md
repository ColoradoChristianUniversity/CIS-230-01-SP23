While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Response 1: Bring up issues with company leadership & recieve proper credit

## Pros
* A civil resolve
* You could gain a raise

## Cons
* Teammate might lose raise

## Script
YOU: Hello, I did most of the work, not my teammate, who does not know what he is doing.

LEADERSHIP: OH. We are sorry for our mistake, here is extra money. Congratulations.

YOU: Thank you very much :smile: 

TEAMMATE: NO! :rage:

## Bible Reference
Proverbs 16:3 (NIV) "Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans."

## First Principle
You should get recognized for your work and it would be irresponsible to let the teammate, who does not really know the job that well, a higher paying job in which he may mess up with greater consequences.

# Response 2: Let the teammate have the promotion

## Pros
* Everyone else is happy 

## Cons
* You did not recieve the credit you deserved
* The company is set up for failure if they continue to let the teammate move up in positions without the expertise. 

## Script
YOU: Hey bro, You do not deserve the promotion but I am not going to say anything.

TEAMMATE: Thanks bro, you're a real one bro :metal:

## Bible Reference
Luke 6:38 (NIV) "Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.""

## First Principle
Let the teammate have the promotion because he might need it more and God might have different plans that will be executed through this mishap.

# Response 3: Convince the teammate to come clean on his own accord

## Pros
* Credit and promotions can be given out appropriately
* Teammate gets to have a learning experience in fixing a wrong

## Cons
* Relationship might be a little rocky for a while

## Script
YOU: Hey man, would you mind going up to company leadership and teling them that you should not be credited as much as they are giving you.

TEAMMATE: Hey bro, yea bro, I gotchu bro no worries bro.

YOU: Thank you

## Bible Reference
Hebrews 12:11 (NIV) "No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it."

## First Principle
Though it might be hard to confront the teammate, doing so and having him fix his own problems makes him more responsible, and the credit to be given out correctly. 

# Conclusion: 
It is unfair for a teammate, that does not really understand the job, to recieve undeserved benefits. Sometimes, it is up to God to decide what to do in these sitiuations. And other times, you have to take steps to correct the mistake. 

# My Choice:
I like the third option because it improves the teammate and you still get credit. But I think in a realistic situation, the first is probably the best if you feel the need for the promotion.
